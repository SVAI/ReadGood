Prevalence (initially estimated at 1: 200,000) is around 1in 60,000. Affected individuals inevitably develop schwannomas, typically affecting both vestibularnerves and leading to hearing loss and deafness. The majority of patients present with hearing loss,which is usually unilateral at onset and may be accompanied or preceded by tinnitus. Vestibularschwannomas may also cause dizziness or imbalance as a first symptom. Nausea, vomiting or truevertigo are rare symptoms, except in late-stage disease. The other main tumours are schwannomasof the other cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves; meningiomas both intracranial (including opticnerve meningiomas) and intraspinal, and some low-grade central nervous system malignancies(ependymomas). Ophthalmic features are also prominent and include reduced visual acuity andcataract. About 70% of NF2 patients have skin tumours (intracutaneous plaque-like lesions or moredeep-seated subcutaneous nodular tumours). Neurofibromatosis type 2 is a dominantly inheritedtumour predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the NF2 gene on chromosome 22. Morethan 50% of patients represent new mutations and as many as one-third are mosaic for theunderlying disease-causing mutation. Although truncating mutations (nonsense and frameshifts) arethe most frequent germline event and cause the most severe disease, single and multiple exondeletions are common. A strategy for detection of the latter is vital for a sensitive analysis.Diagnosis is based on clinical and neuroimaging studies. Presymptomatic genetic testing is anintegral part of the management of NF2 families. Prenatal diagnosis and pre-implantation geneticdiagnosis is possible. The main differential diagnosis of NF2 is schwannomatosis. NF2 represents adifficult management problem with most patients facing substantial morbidity and reduced lifeexpectancy. Surgery remains the focus of current management although watchful waiting withcareful surveillance and occasionally radiation treatment have a role. Prognosis is adversely affectedby early age at onset, a higher number of meningiomas and having a truncating mutation. In thefuture, the development of tailored drug therapies aimed at the genetic level are likely to providehuge improvements for this devastating condition.Disease name and synonymsNeurofibromatosis type 2(NF2), Bilateral acoustic neu-rofibromatosis, Central neurofibromatosis.

Thisis complicated by the high rate of mosaicism [4]. Therehave only been two epidemiological studies of NF2 one inNorth West England [5,6], [Evans DG et al. Birth inci-dence and prevalence of tumour prone syndromes: esti-mates from a UK genetic family register service. Am J MedGenet 2009. unpublished] and one in Finland [7]. Theincidence of NF2 was initially reported as 1:33–40,000individuals in a 4 million population in England [5]. Dis-ease prevalence was somewhat lower at 1: 200,000. How-ever, a recent update suggests that the incidence may be ashigh as 1:25,000 [6]. Disease prevalence has now risen toaround 1 in 60,000 due to earlier diagnosis and better sur-vival due to improved treatment [Evans DG et al. Birthincidence and prevalence of tumour prone syndromes:estimates from a UK genetic family register service. Am JMed Genet 2009. unpublished]. A lower incidence of 1 in87,410 was reported in a 1.7 million population in Fin-land [7].Clinical descriptionNF2, in contrast to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) ischaracterised by the development of schwannomas, men-ingiomas and ependymomas, with the great majority ofpatients developing bilateral schwannoma involvementof the superior vestibular branch of the eighth cranialnerve [1]. Although the disease is still classified as "neu-rofibromatosis", neurofibromas are relatively infrequent.The first clear description of NF2 was in 1822 by Wishart[8]. NF1 was fully delineated in the late nineteenth cen-tury by von Recklinghausen. However, it was the eminentHarvey Cushing, who described bilateral eighth nervetumours occuring as part of von Recklinghausen diseasein 1916 [9]. This description is largely responsible for theconfusion between the two conditions which continuedfor many years. Indeed, the literature prior to 1985 hasmany NF2 cases being described as part of von Reckling-hausen disease, with bilateral vestibular schwannomas(VS) being included in a major patient series [10].The hallmark of NF2 is the development of bilateral VS.VS usually present with hearing loss, tinnitus or imbal-ance or a combination of the three symptoms. The othermain tumour features are schwannomas of the other cra-nial, spinal and peripheral nerves; meningiomas bothintracranial (including optic nerve meningiomas) andintraspinal; and some low-grade central nervous system(CNS) malignancies (ependymomas and gliomas). Fourlarge clinical studies have now confirmed this clinical pic-ture [1,11-13] (Table 2). Individuals may present with cra-nial meningiomas or a spinal tumour long before theappearance of a VS.The majority of individuals with NF2 present with hearingloss, which is usually unilateral at time of onset. The hear-ing loss may be accompanied or preceded by tinnitus. VSmay also cause features such as dizziness or imbalance asthe first symptom. Nausea, vomiting or true vertigo arerare symptoms except in late stage disease.A significant proportion of cases (20–30%) present withsymptoms from an intracranial meningioma (headaches,seizures), spinal tumour (pain, muscle weakness, paraes-thesia), or cutaneous tumour [1,11-13]. Indeed, the firstsign of more severe multi-tumour disease in early child-hood is often a non-8th nerve tumour (including a cutane-ous tumour), or an ocular presentation [14]. Adultpresentation is thus quite different to paediatric presenta-tion, in which VS accounts for as little as 15–30% of initialsymptoms. There also appears to be a tendency to monon-europathy, particularly affecting the facial nerve causing aBell's-like palsy, which does not fully recover years beforethe detection of a VS. Some children present with a polio-like illness with wasting of muscle groups in a lower limb,which again does not fully recover. In adulthood, a moregeneralised symptomtatic severe polyneuropathy occursin about 3–5% of patients, often associated with an"onion bulb" appearance on nerve biopsy [1]. This canprogress, leading to severe muscle wasting and even death.However, around 40% of patients will show evidence ofpolyneuropathy on nerve conduction studies [15].Table 1: Diagnostic criteria for Neurofibromatosis type 2 (these include the NIH criteria with additional criteria)Main criteriaAdditional criteriaBilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) or family history of NF2 plusUnilateral VS plus any two of: meningioma, glioma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, and posterior subcapsular opacities1) Unilateral VS oror2) Any two of: meningioma, glioma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, posterior subcapsular lenticular opacitiesMultiple meningioma (two or more) plus unilateral VS or any two of: glioma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, and cataractNF2 – Neurofibromatosis type 2; NIH – National Institutes of Health; VS – vestibular schwannomasOrphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2009, 4:16http://www.ojrd.com/content/4/1/16Page 3 of 11(page number not for citation purposes)Ophthalmic features are also prominent in NF2. Patientsoften suffer from reduced visual acuity of various causes.Between 60–80% of patients have cataracts [1,10,11],which are usually presenile posterior subcapsular lenticu-lar opacities that rarely require removal. However, corticalwedge opacities may be present from near birth. Opticnerve meningiomas can cause visual loss in the first yearsof life and extensive retinal hamartomas can also affectvision. Misdiagnosis of both of these abnormalities asretinoblastoma has led to the eye being removed in thefirst few years of life.The skin is a useful aid to diagnosis, but cutaneous fea-tures in NF2 are much more subtle than in NF1. About70% of NF2 patients have skin tumours, but only 10%have more than ten skin tumours. The tumours appear tobe of at least three different types. The most frequent typeis a plaque-like lesion, which is intra-cutaneous, slightlyraised and more pigmented than surrounding skin, oftenwith excess hair. More deep-seated subcutaneous nodulartumours can often be felt, sometimes on major peripheralnerves. These tumours occur as a fusiform swelling of thenerve with thickened nerve palpable on either side. Thereare also occasional intracutaneous tumours similar tothose in NF1. The great majority of these tumours areschwannomas, but occasional definite neurofibromas dooccur.EtiopathogenesisNF1 and NF2 were eventually recognised as separategenetic and clinical diseases with the localisation of therespective genes to chromosome 17 and 22 [16,17]. Thiswas followed by the formal clinical delineation at aNational Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus meeting inthe USA in 1987 [18]. It is now clear that NF2 is a geneti-cally homogeneous condition, with no evidence foranother genetic cause of classical NF2 (bilateral VS).Seizinger et al. were the first to show loss of constitutionalheterozygosity of chromosome 22, with DNA markers lostin tumours from a patient with NF2 [19]. As such NF2 wasone of the first inherited tumour prone disorders to belocalised to a specific genetic location. Linkage studiesthen confirmed that all affected members of the large fam-ily carried the same copy of chromosome 22q. The NF2gene was then isolated by the simultaneous discovery ofconstitutional and tumour deletions in a gene coding fora cell membrane-related protein, which has been termedmerlin or schwannomin by the two groups who isolatedit [2,3].Table 2: Clinical characteristics of Neurofibromatosis type 2 patients in four studiesCharacteristicStudyKanter et al.

The majorityof these mutations were truncating mutations, leading toa smaller and probably non-functional protein product.Early studies suggested that missense mutations (whichresult in a complete protein product) and large deletions(which result in no protein product) both caused predom-inantly mild phenotypes. Larger studies of detailed geno-type/phenotype correlations in multiple families haveconfirmed this finding [21-26]. Phenotype is more varia-ble in patients with splice-site mutations, with milder dis-ease in patients with mutations in exons 9–15 [26,27].Definitive evidence from effects on survival have beenestablished with missense mutation patients having statis-tically greater survival than nonsense and frameshiftmutations [26]. As in other tumour prone disorders thefrequency of large genomic rearrangements did notbecome apparent until some time after the gene wascloned, due to the poor availability of methods to allowroutine clinical screening for their presence. About half ofthese are detectable with standard cytogenetic analysiswith FISH [28]. A small number of constitutional abnor-malities such as chromosome translocations and ring 22would still need a cytogenetic analysis to confirm theirpresence. The majority of large scale rearrangements arenow routinely detected by Multiplex Ligation-dependantProbe Amplification (MLPA) and are known to accountfor around 15% of NF2 germline aberrations [28,29]. Thecommonest of this class of mutations is a deletion of theNF2 promoter, exon 1 and most of intron 1 and deletionsof the whole gene, indeed combined these two accountfor over half of all MLPA abnormalities (Table 3). The dif-fering frequency of the various types of NF2 mutationbetween familial, sporadic and mosaic cases can be seenin Table 4. This represents the output from one centrededicated to whole gene analysis with the great majorityof patients having been screened by a technique capableof the detection of large deletions or duplications. Moreextensive lists of NF2 mutations described worldwide areavailable online and in recent reviews [30-32], but theseare less likely to reflect the true ratios of different classesof mutations, as a variety of different techniques havebeen used. The sensitivity of genetic testing usingsequence analysis and MLPA can be derived from column1 (Table 1). Ninety-three per cent of mutations have beenidentified in the second generation of NF2 families. Of themissing eight families six have been subjected to moredetailed analysis including RNA analysis. Two putativesplicing variants deep in the introns have been identifiedbased on Protein Truncation Testing and intronicsequencing (Messaien L, personal communication), butno other mutations have been found.A considerable proportion of NF2 patients, particularlymilder cases, have mosaic disease, in which only a propor-tion of cells contain the mutated NF2 gene. The initiatingmutation occurs after conception, leading to two separatecell lineages. The proportion of cells affected depends onhow early in development the mutation occurs. Recentevidence suggests that up to 20–30% of NF2 cases withouta family history of the disease are mosaic, carrying themutation in too small a proportion or none of their lym-phocytes to be detected from a blood sample [4,33-35].This accounts for the milder disease course in many indi-viduals with unfound mutations, and since only a subsetof germ cells (or none) will carry the mutation, there isless than a 50% risk of transmitting the disease to theiroffspring. However, if an offspring has inherited themutation, they will have a typical phenotype and usuallybe more severely affected than their parent, since the off-spring will carry the mutation in all of their cells. One ofthe features that suggested that mosaicism existed in NF2was that NF2 mutations were harder to find in blood inisolated non inherited cases than in patients who hadinherited the disease from an affected parent. Mosaicismmay be particularly likely in NF2 if the tumours are pre-dominantly on one side of the body. The mosaic muta-tion can be detected by analysing tumour material froman affected individual. If an identical mutation is found intwo tumours from that individual, their offspring can betested for the presence of the mutation. Also when twoalterations, either: two mutations or one mutation plusone allele loss, are found in on tumour, one of these mustbe the constitutional one. Thus offspring can be tested forboth abnormalities and potentially exclude inheritingNF2.C > T transitions leading to a nonsense mutation are themost common mutations in the NF2 gene [30-32]. Theseaccount for the only significant variation in mutation fre-quency across the NF2 gene apart from the lack of muta-tions in exons 16 and 17 and a relatively low frequency inexon 9 [30].Somatic mutationsThere are notable similarities, but also differencesbetween the distribution and type of germline andsomatic NF2 mutations. Among germline mutations inclassic NF2, nonsense mutations are more common thanframeshift mutations by a ratio of 1.3:1, but this ratio isreversed for somatic mutations [36]. In both situationsNF2 nonsense mutations, C > T transitions in CGAcodons and non-CGA codons are the most common sin-gle base-pair transitions. However there is a markedabsence of mutations in exons 14 and 15 in sporadic men-ingioma. One recently reported phenomenon is theincreasing drift from nonsense mutations in the germlineand early somatic mutations to a predominance ofOrphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2009, 4:16http://www.ojrd.com/content/4/1/16Page 5 of 11(page number not for citation purposes)frameshift mutations in the tumours of older patientswith vestibular schwannoma [36]. This is likely to be dueto a deficiency in certain DNA repair pathways in olderpatients [36].Although it is thought that effectively all schwannomasrequire inactivation of the NF2 gene, no reports apartfrom those studying NF2 protein have confirmed a 100%knock out of both copies of the NF2 gene. This is likely tobe due to diversity of mechanisms that inactivate the gene.The standard approach of mutational analysis and Loss ofConstitutional Heterozygosity (LOH) on tumours willdetect involvement of NF2 in about 80–90% of schwan-nomas, but both copies can only be confirmed as affectedin about 50–60% of cases. The mechanism of LOH is alsonot straightforward, whilst most cases involve loss ofTable 3: MLPA abnormalities in 62 unrelated familiesMLPA abnormalityNumber of occasions (mosaic)Exon 1-intron1 (deletes intronic CA repeat)18 (3)Whole gene (exons 1–17) deletion16 (2)Exons 5–17 deletion3 (2)Exons 2–3 deletion2Exons 2–10 deletion2Exons 13–15 deletion1Exons 1–16 deletion2 (1)Exons 1–10 deletion3 (1)Exons 1–3 deletion1Exons 1–4 deletion2 (1)Exons 1–2 deletion1 (1)Exons 15–17 deletion1Exons 8–17 deletion1Exons 8–15 deletion1Exon 3 deletion1Exon 7 deletion1Exon 5 deletion1Exons 12–14 duplication1Exons 10–16 duplication1Exon 2 deletion1Exon 8 deletion1Exons 2–4 deletion1MLPA- Multiplex Ligation-dependant Probe AmplificationOrphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2009, 4:16http://www.ojrd.com/content/4/1/16Page 6 of 11(page number not for citation purposes)chromosome 22 or at least the long arm, a proportion arenow known to be due to mitotic recombination withessentially two identical copies of a mutated NF2 geneand distal 22q [37]. This mechanism is now thought to bea primary cause of NF2 inactivation in schwannomatosis.It is now known that between 20–40% of sporadicschwannomas are inactivated by NF2 methylation [38,39]and in a similar fashion to TP16 this could involve bothcopies of NF2 and explain why some tumours do not har-bour identifiable point mutations or LOH. Approximately60% of sporadic meningiomas have NF2 gene involve-ment and promoter methylation again plays a significantrole [40].DiagnosisThe Manchester (modified NIH) diagnostic criteria forNF2 are shown in Table 1. The original NIH criteria havebeen expanded to include patients with no family historywho have multiple schwannomas and or meningiomas,but who have not yet developed bilateral 8th nervetumours. Patients who have asymmetric involvement arelikely to be mosaic [41]. At very young ages (< 18 years)individuals presenting with an apparently isolated menin-gioma [14] or vestibular schwannoma [42] are have a20% and 10% likelihood respectively of developing NF2.However after 20 years of age this rate drops dramaticallyand the diagnosis becomes very unlikely after 30 years ofage [42].Diagnostic methods(cid:129) Clinical and family history(cid:129) Examination including cutaneous and ophthalmic(Slit lamp)(cid:129) Craniospinal MRI(cid:129) Molecular analysisDifferential diagnosisThe main differential diagnosis of NF2 is schwannomato-sis and some patients with multiple non cranial schwan-nomas turn out to have mosaic NF2 [34,35]. However,patients fulfilling the most sensitive Manchester criteriaare unlikely to be misclassified [43].Antenatal diagnosis and genetic counsellingNF2 is an autosomal dominant disease with usually a50% risk of transmission from an affected individual totheir offspring. This was first confirmed in a large familyreported by Gardner and Frazier in 1930. 50–60% ofpatients have no family history and represent de novomutations in the NF2 gene [1-3]. Individuals who inherita pathogenic mutation in the NF2 gene will almost alwaysdevelop symptoms by 60 years of age [7]. Exceptionally,patients particularly in the pre MRI era will have not beendiagnosed in their lifetime. Although the transmissionrate is 50% in the second generation and beyond, the riskof transmission in an apparently isolated patient withNF2 is less than 50% due to mosaicism [4].Because detection of tumours at an early stage is effectivein improving the clinical management of NF2, pre-symp-Table 4: Mutations identified in 529 families with Neurofibromatosis type 2 in the Manchester (UK) genetics laboratoryType of mutationDetection in 2nd generation (n = 108)Detection in sporadic non mosaic patients (% non mosaic)Mosaic mutations (% of mosaic)TotalSplice site35 (32%)43 (22%)3 (4%)80 (15%)MLPA positive23 (20%)28 (14%)11 (15%)62 (12%)FSD18 (17%)36 (18%)20 (26%)74 (13%)Nonsense16 (15%)67 (35%)28 (37%)111 (22%)Missense7 (6%)5 (3%)1 (1%)13 (2.5%)FSI3 (3%)11 (7%)6 (8%)20 (4%)IFD1 (1%)13 (4%)5 (1%)Ring 22003 (4%)3Not found7 (7%)230 (55%)158166/529 (31%)Total108191/421 (45%)72529Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2009, 4:16http://www.ojrd.com/content/4/1/16Page 7 of 11(page number not for citation purposes)tomatic genetic testing is an integral part of the manage-ment of NF2 families. Once a mutation has beenidentified in an affected individual, a 100% specific test isavailable for the family. However, mutation screeningmay not reveal the causative mutation. Predictive diagno-sis by linkage analysis using intragenic markers or markersflanking the NF2 gene is also possible in the great majorityof families with two or more living affected individuals. Inthe absence of a genetic test a cumulative age at onsetcurve [44] can be used. Age at onset curves aid geneticcounselling; for example, the risk of having inherited NF2for an asymptomatic at-risk individual 25 years of age,prior to screening, drops to 25%. The risk to an unaffected30 year old with a normal scan would be < 10%. Tumouranalysis plays a vital role in providing genetic testing forthe offspring of sporadic patients. Indeed analysis shouldif possible first be carried out on tumour so that a targetedapproach can be used on the blood sample. If both muta-tional events are identified in the NF2 gene in a tumourand neither is present in the blood the patient must bemosaic for one of these mutations [33-35,45,46]. Even ifonly LOH is identified this still allows exclusion of NF2 in50% of offspring if they can be shown to have inheritedthe allele "lost" in the tumour [35,46]. At-risk individualswho are shown not to have inherited the mutated NF2gene do not need further follow-up.Even in the absence of identifying a mutation the residualrisk of NF2 can be substantially reduced in the child of anapparently isolated case. In particular patients presentingwith asymmetric disease over 40 years of age with negativemutation analysis in blood would have a very low chanceof transmitting NF2 to their children (Table 5).Because of the severity of NF2 there is a demand for pre-natal diagnosis and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.Use of the techniques above means that this is possible inthe great majority of families.Screening protocolChildren of affected patients should be considered to beat 50% risk of NF2 and screening for NF2 can start at birth.Cataracts can affect vision in early life and other tumourimplications are present in the first ten years of life, partic-ularly cranial meningiomas. Formal screening for VSshould start at ten years, as it is rare for tumours tobecome symptomatic before that time even in severelyaffected families. Annual audiological tests includingauditory brainstem response are still a useful adjunct toMRI [44]. Surgery is unlikely to be more successful fortumours < 6 mm than for tumours sized 6 mm, but VSgrowth is higher in younger patients, so for asymptomaticat-risk individuals without tumours, MRI screening everytwo years for those < 20 years old and every 3–5 years forthose age > 20 years should be sufficient. The initial MRIscan could be at around 12 years of age, or 10 years inseverely affected families. Once tumours are present, MRIscreening should probably be at least annual. Spinaltumours are seen in 60–80% of NF2 patients on MRI [47-50]. While only 25–30% of patients with spinal tumoursrequire a spinal operation from a symptomatic tumour, afull annual neurological examination is probably a wiseprecaution with Spinal MRI only every 3 years or if thereTable 5: Transmission risks to offspring for isolated cases of Neurofibromatosis type 2 before and after negative mutation testing.

Identifying the affected patient's mutation not onlyallows testing of at risk relatives, but may also give impor-tant indicators as to the patient's own prognosis. As 25–30% of NF2 patients are mosaic frozen tumour should betaken at operation (with patient consent) for genetic tests.NF2 managementNF2 presents many difficult management dilemmas. Themainstay of management of NF2 is surgical removal ofsymptomatic cranial and spinal tumours. The timing ofremoval of vestibular schwannomas is a more difficultarea. Surgical results are certainly far better when man-aged by an experienced team [50-52]. There is clear evi-dence of a reduction in mortality with a significantlyincreased life expectancy for NF2 patients managed at 3specialty centres in the UK (OR 0.34) [53]. It is importantto balance the use of microsurgery and radiation treat-ment, which can have a role in patients who have particu-larly aggressive tumours, or who are poor surgical risks, orwho refuse surgery. Teams experienced in the positioningof brainstem implants can offer partial auditory rehabili-tation to those who are deaf, although results are stillbehind those achievable for cochlear implants. Althoughthe cochlear nerve may be left initially intact after surgeryits blood supply may be damaged, nonetheless a fewpatients can be rehabilitated successfully with a cochlearimplant.OutcomesEven with improvements in microsurgery and with use ofradiation therapy, the great majority of individuals withNF2 become completely deaf. The tumours in NF2 aremore difficult to treat than those of sporadic unilateral VS,as NF2 VS are often multifocal, appearing "like a bunch ofgrapes" around the vestibular nerve in particular. There isevidence for a histological difference, with NF2 VS beingmore lobular and less vascular then their sporadic coun-terparts [54]. This leads to a greater risk of facial nervedamage in NF2. Loss of facial nerve function is one of themost feared aspects of the condition for many sufferers,although in good surgical hands this complication is nowmuch less common [50,52]. Patients may also be severelydisabled by a combination of poor balance, visual prob-lems and weakness due to spinal tumours. Indeed, manyNF2 patients become wheelchair-bound in early adult-hood. Many patients with multi-tumour disease die intheir twenties and thirties. In view of the multiplicity ofproblems affecting many patients it is strongly recom-mended that NF2 patients are managed by a multidiscipli-nary team in specialist centres [52].Specialty centresA typical NF2 specialist centre will require involvement ofa number of key staff members.Permanent clinic staffNeurosurgeon, Otolaryngologist, physician (neurologist/geneticist), clinic nurse/patient link worker and a dedi-cated clinic secretary.Clinic equipment: lightwriter/pallantype/voice activatedsoftware.In order to minimise patient visits morning scanning withlunchtime radiological review and an afternoon clinic ispreferable.Each clinic should have access to a namedNeuroradiologist, ophthalmologist, peripheral nerve sur-geon, plastic surgeon, neurologist/geneticist (if notinvolved in main clinic), hearing therapist, physiothera-pist, paediatrician.Patients should be given the option of a radiation therapyopinion, which will only be available at a few centres.Managing affected childrenNF2 is being recognised more and more frequently inchildhood often before VS have developed. Recognitionof the more severe disease course with early presentationand the more atypical features such as mononeuropathyare important.SurgeryVS in NF2 are more difficult to treat than those of sporadicunilateral VS because NF2-related VS are often multifocalin the eighth nerve complex, and the potential for associ-ated facial nerve schwannomas. Surgery to remove VS inNF2 almost always leads to total deafness with loss of thecochlear nerve. Despite the great improvement in VS sur-gery over the last three decades, facial nerve damage andother adverse outcomes remain a real possibility duringtumour removal, especially in the hands of less experi-enced VS surgeons. Facial weakness may threaten thehealth of the eye as a result of loss of the protective blinkreflex. and as the lacrimal gland is also supplied by thefacial nerve the loss of tear production will increase thisrisk. If facial nerve damage coexists with loss of cornealsensation from damage to the trigeminal nerve then theeye becomes exceptionally vulnerable to corneal ulcera-tion and blindness.The cornerstone of modern NF2 management is conserva-tion of function, and the maintenance of "quality of life".The mere presence of a tumour is not an indication for itsremoval. Serious thought must be given to the benefitsOrphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2009, 4:16http://www.ojrd.com/content/4/1/16Page 9 of 11(page number not for citation purposes)that are sought and the risks and complications of the sur-gery, and the treatment must be tailored to the needs ofthe individual patient [52]. Attempts at hearing preserva-tion surgery should be limited to experienced centres whocan offer a realistic chance of maintaining both the coch-lear nerve, but also cochlea function. If hearing is lost afterapparent cochlear nerve preservation the patient may stillbe suitable for a cochlear implant. In many if not mostinstances the best policy will be to observe VS to decide onthe best time to balance surgical morbidity against thealmost inevitable loss of hearing.The principle of minimal interference for VS appliesequally to schwannomas on other cranial nerves, tointracranial meningiomas, and to spinal tumours. It isvery uncommon to have to remove a schwannoma grow-ing on a cranial nerve other than the eighth because thesetumours appear to have a much slower growth patternthan NF2 VS. Spinal tumours are mostly considered forexcision if they are clearly producing symptoms or physi-cal signs. In the absence of any dramatic growth oftumours, the head should be scanned every year and thespine every 3 years.Radiation therapyIt is important to balance the use of microsurgery andradiation treatment, which has a role in patients who arepoor surgical candidates, or who refuse or wish to avoidsurgery because of its associated risks. Radiation therapyshould be mentioned as a management option, even if thetumour is larger than the size criterion for treatment. Theupper limit of size for radiotherapy is generally a maxi-mum intracranial diameter of 3 cm [55]. The patientshould be aware of the management options even if thetumour is not suitable for a particular treatment modality.In NF2 cases selected for radiosurgery tumour controlrates are of the order of 50%, with 40% retaining pre-treat-ment hearing for at least 3 years [56]. This is nonethelesssubstantially worse than for sporadic vestibular schwan-nomas.Surgeons should use clinical judgement as to when to rec-ommend radiation therapy [52]. Follow-up for life withinterval scanning is necessary, although this would berequired for NF2 anyway. Patients should be made awareof the variable reported outcomes of the treatment andthe risk of the radiation-induced malignant change, whichhas been reported disproportionately more in NF2 thansporadic patients [57,58]. The tumour may also be moredifficult to excise after radiotherapy, and that reportedfacial nerve outcomes after surgery following stereotacticradiation therapy are frequently poor [59].New therapiesThe NF2 protein appears to impact on multiple intracellu-lar signalling pathways. These pathways include the PI3-kinase/Akt, Raf/MEK/ERK and mTOR pathways [60]. Inparticular, studies using NF2-derived tumour tissue revealelevated levels of phosphorylated Akt. More recently, Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Merlin on 2 residues (Thr-230 and Ser-315) has been shown to target Merlin forubiquitin-dependent degradation. Although no PI3kinase or Akt inhibitors have yet been approved for treat-ment, there are multiple compounds in development –primarily for oncology indications. The Raf/MEK/ERKpathway has been implicated in NF2 tumorigenesis inpart through identification of elevated levels of phospho-ERK and phospho-MEK.The progress being made in cellular research especiallywith regard to pathways in which the NF2 gene productinteracts raises the hopes of targeted therapy. Targeting theERK1/, AKT, integrin/focal adhesion kinase/Src/Ras sign-aling cascades, PDGFRbeta, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase C/Src/c-Raf pathway, VEG-F andother pathways [60,61] means that drugs such as avastin,elotinib [62], lapatinib and sorafenib [63] may well bearfruit.PrognosisNF2 remains a life limiting and life spoiling condition.Patients diagnosed prior to 1990 had only a 15 year lifeexpectancy from diagnosis [1,64]. Improvement in man-agement and early diagnosis are improving these out-comes but many people with NF2 still die very young.Prognosis is adversely affected by early age at onset,number of meningiomas and having a truncating muta-tion [52].Unresolved questions1. What is the most appropriate molecular/cell biolog-ical target(s) for therapy2. What are the long term safety issues of radiationtreatments and does fractionated radiotherapy offeradvantages over sterotactic or gamma knife treatmentConclusionNF2 remains a condition that is life spoiling and life lim-iting. Multidisciplinary management with early diagnosisare mainstays of management. Hopefully new targetedtherapies will revolutionise the outcomes in this condi-tion.AbbreviationsNF2: neurofibromatosis type 2; MRI: magnetic resonanceimaging; NF1: neurofibromatosis type 1; VS: vestibularschwannomas; CNS: central nervous system; NIH:National Institutes of Health; SSCP: single strand confor-mational polymorphism; MLPA: multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification; LOH: loss of constitu-tional heterozygosity.Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2009, 4:16http://www.ojrd.com/content/4/1/16Page 10 of 11(page number not for citation purposes)Competing interestsThe author declares that they have no competing interests.References1.Evans DGR, Huson S, Donnai D, Neary W, Blair V, Newton V, HarrisR: A clinical study of type 2 neurofibromatosis.
