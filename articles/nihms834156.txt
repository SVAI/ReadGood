Koch Institute of Integrative Cancer Biology, Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USAAbstractThe noncoding genome affects gene regulation and disease, yet we lack tools for rapid identification and manipulation of noncoding elements. We develop a CRISPR screen employing ~18,000 sgRNAs targeting >700 kb surrounding the genes NF1, NF2, and CUL3, which are involved in BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma. We find that noncoding locations that modulate drug resistance also harbor predictive hallmarks of noncoding function. With a subset of regions at the CUL3 locus, we demonstrate that engineered mutations alter transcription factor occupancy and long-range and local epigenetic environments, implicating these sites in gene regulation and chemotherapeutic resistance. Though our expansion of the potential of pooled CRISPR screens we provide tools for genomic discovery and for elucidating biologically relevant mechanisms of gene regulation.Pooled CRISPR mutagenesis identifies functional elements in the noncoding genome.More than 98% of the human genome does not code for proteins, however, unlike the coding genome there exists no overarching framework to translate noncoding genomic sequence into functional elements (1, 2). Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggests many noncoding regions are critical for human health (3, 4). The significance of these associations, however, has been difficult to assess, in part because we lack the tools to determine which variants alter functional elements. Molecular hallmarks, such as epigenetic †Correspondence should be addressed to: nsanjana@nygenome.org (N.S.) and zhang@broadinstitute.org (F.Z.).*These authors contributed equally to this work.‡Present address: New York Genome Center, New York, NY 10013, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, NY 10012.Supplementary MaterialsMaterials and MethodsSupplementary TextFigures S1 to S13Tables S1 to S7References (26–42)HHS Public AccessAuthor manuscriptScience.

However, these predictions largely bypass regions lacking hallmarks, and it is difficult to ascertain what hallmarks play a correlative or truly causal role in function or phenotype (6, 7). Efforts to determine causality have employed preselected DNA fragments with expression serving as a proxy for function (8) but these methods lack the local chromatin context and broader regulatory interactions. Thus there is a need for systematic approaches to sift through noncoding variants and determine if and how they affect phenotypes within a native biological context.For this purpose, we designed a high-throughput method using pooled CRISPR (Clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries to screen noncoding genomic loci to identify functional regions related to phenotype and gene regulation. Previous applications of CRISPR screens within the noncoding genome have focused on specific functional elements (e.g. miRNAs, transcription factor binding sites) or required fluorescent reporters (9–12). Here, we comprehensively assay a total of 715 kb of sequence surrounding three different genes by performing unbiased mutagenesis to identify functional elements relevant to cancer drug resistance.Vemurafenib inhibits BRAF proteins carrying the V600E mutation, found in 50–70% of melanomas (13). Resistance to vemurafenib arises within months in almost all melanoma patients (14) and surviving tumor cells display increased malignancy that rapidly leads to lethality (15). A genome-scale CRISPR screen found that loss-of-function mutations in NF1, NF2, and CUL3 result in vemurafenib resistance (16). To explore if mutations in the noncoding regions around these three genes could similarly impact drug resistance, we designed three sgRNA libraries tiling across 100 kb regions 5´ and 3´ of each gene’s major isoforms (Fig. 1A). For each library, we synthesized the sgRNAs as a pool (6,682 for NF1, 6,934 for NF2, and 4,699 for CUL3; 18,315 sgRNAs total) and cloned them into a lentiviral vector (fig. S1). We transduced A375 human melanoma cells, which carry the BRAF mutation, with the sgRNA libraries at a low multiplicity of infection and cultured them in 2uM vemurafenib or control (DMSO) for 14 days. Using deep sequencing, we counted the representation of sgRNAs in the library in both conditions (Fig. 1B–D) and identified vemurafenib-enriched sgRNAs as those enriched >4 standard deviations from the control distribution (fig. S2).Overall, most sgRNAs were depleted after treatment with vemurafenib, which is expected since vemurafenib targets the oncogene addiction that drives A375 growth (Fig. 1E). However, in all three libraries, we found a small group of sgRNAs that were enriched after vemurafenib treatment (log2 ratio of Vemu/Control > 0), with the CUL3 library having the largest percentage of enriched sgRNAs. As we also included a small number of sgRNAs targeting the coding region of each gene, most sgRNAs targeting coding regions (70 – 80%) were enriched, as expected (fig. S3A). However, amongst the sgRNAs targeting noncoding regions, approximately 4-fold more sgRNAs were enriched in the CUL3 library than in the NF1 or NF2 libraries (7.2% in CUL3, 1.7% in NF1, and 2.1% in NF2), suggesting the presence of more gene regulatory elements in the noncoding regions flanking the gene (fig. S3A). To determine if this increase in putative gene regulatory elements in the 200 kb region Sanjana et al.Page 2Science. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 March 30.Author ManuscriptAuthor ManuscriptAuthor ManuscriptAuthor Manuscriptsurrounding CUL3 is also reflected in human gene expression and genotyping data, we queried the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database (7,051 tissue samples from 449 donors). Indeed, we found that CUL3 had the largest number of cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (n = 161 eQTLs, mean effect size = −0.21), and the region targeted by the sgRNA library overlaps with a large number of these eQTLs (fig. S3B) (17). We thus chose to focus our downstream analysis and validation efforts on CUL3.We visualized the enriched sgRNAs in a genome browser-style view (Figs. 1F, S4A, B). We found that a higher percentage of sgRNAs targeting gene-proximal elements were enriched compared to other noncoding regions (Fig. 1G) and greater enrichment for sgRNAs targeting noncoding elements on the 5´ side of the gene than for those on the 3´ side (fig. S4C).To test if regions targeted by enriched sgRNAs from the screen physically interact with the CUL3 promoter via chromatin looping (18), we created three independent chromosome conformation capture (3C) libraries (Fig. 2A) (19). We quantified the interaction frequency for each site across the ~200 kb region (43) and found that regions on the 5´ side of CUL3 tend to interact more strongly with the promoter. Regions with higher 3C interaction contain, on average, more vemurafenib-enriched sgRNAs (Fig. 2B).Since chromatin accessibility can identify regulatory regions (20, 21), we performed Assay of Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) in A375 melanoma, MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma and U87 glioblastoma cells (Fig. 2C). Overall, we found higher sgRNA enrichment near A375-specific ATAC peaks than near those from other cell types, which was replicated with DNAseI hypersensitivity data (Figs. 2D–E, S5). These regions suggest the presence of cell type-specific enhancers (22, 23). Even though the accessible peaks overlap with enriched sgRNA sites, the chromatin accessibility data by itself only predicts a small fraction of the total number of enriched sgRNA sites (table S1).Since evolutionary conservation varies widely across the noncoding genome, we sought to test whether regions exhibiting higher levels of conservation harbor more enriched sgRNAs. We examined phastCons conservation scores among primates, placental mammals, and vertebrates over the CUL3 locus (Fig. 2F) (24). Overall, enriched sgRNAs are ~1.8-fold more likely to be found near peaks of primate conservation and are ~1.7-fold less likely to be found near conservation peaks among mammals and vertebrates (Figs. 2G, S5). In contrast, the genomic sites of sgRNAs targeting coding regions of CUL3 do not demonstrate differential conservation (phastCons probability ~ 0.95 in primates, mammals and vertebrates). This observation supports recent findings that enhancers evolve rapidly in a lineage- or species-specific manner and conserved enhancers between mammals tend to be rare (25).To confirm that mutations in these specific noncoding regions were mediated by CUL3 and lead to altered drug resistance, we transduced cells with individual sgRNAs having at least one other enriched sgRNA within 500 bp (Fig. 3A). We validated that the sgRNA created mutations at the intended target sites (fig. S6) and found that 24 out of the 25 sgRNAs resulted in decreased CUL3 expression relative to non-targeting sgRNAs (Fig. 3B). As expected, there is a negative correlation between CUL3 gene expression and vemurafenib Sanjana et al.Page 3Science.

S7).Next, we surveyed changes in post-translational histone modifications at each target site (fig. S8A) (43). With target sites near the promoter, we found a 56% average decrease of H3K4me3 after editing (p = 7×10−4, n = 9 sites) (Fig. 3D), consistent with the reduced gene expression. At distal sites, we found a 41% average decrease in H3K27ac (p = 0.02, n = 7 sites) after editing and no significant change in H3K4me2 (p = 0.82, n = 7 sites) (Fig. 3D), although a subset of H3K4me2 levels decreased after editing (fig. S8B). We also found that mutagenesis of a ~22 kb distal histone acetyl-transferase (p300) binding site that has a strong 3C promoter interaction results in a 75% decline of promoter H3K27ac and a 50% decrease in CUL3 expression (fig. S9, 43).By examining regions targeted by enriched sgRNAs, we found individual loci containing the canonical transcription factor binding motifs for Yin Yang 1 (YY1), Zinc Finger Protein 263 (ZNF263), CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and activation protein 1 (AP-1) complex which were disrupted after editing (Figs. 4A–D, S10). We found that mutations within these binding sites abrogate transcription factor recruitment leading to loss of CUL3 expression (Figs. 4E–H). For example, specific sgRNAs that target near a YY1 ChIP peak (Fig. 4B) disrupt the YY1 motif (fig. S11) and vemurafenib treatment selects for mutations that are more deleterious to the binding site (fig. S12). Although both sgRNAs targeting near the site decrease YY1 binding, the sgRNA whose cut site overlaps the motif more efficiently disrupts YY1 binding (67% vs. 26%) (Fig. 4E). In addition, mutagenesis by either sgRNA significantly decreases CUL3 expression. Similarly, 2 sgRNAs in the first intron of CUL3 spaced 30 bp apart overlap a ZNF263 ChIP-seq peak (Fig. 4B). Both result in a significant decrease in ZNF263 occupancy and in CUL3 expression (Fig. 4F).Although we observed a bias in the presence of regulatory elements 5´ of the transcription start site, we did find several enriched sgRNAs downstream of CUL3 (Fig. 4C, D) (43). One sgRNA cuts inside the core motif of CTCF (Fig. 4C). After editing, CTCF occupancy is decreased by 45% with a concurrent 30% decrease in CUL3 expression (Fig. 4G). For AP-1, a heterodimer of FOS and JUN, editing at either of two nearby sites decreases FOS and JUN binding compared with control cells and decreases CUL3 expression by ~25% (Fig. 4H). Overall, as in the pooled screen, transcription factor binding sites located on the 3´ side exhibit weaker effects on gene expression than those located on the 5´ side.Thus we show how a Cas9-mediated systematic dissection of noncoding loci can identify functional elements involved in gene regulation and cancer drug resistance. In combination with other genome-wide assays, we demonstrate high-throughput identification of regions where changes in chromatin context and transcription factor binding are causally linked to loss of gene expression and a disease-relevant phenotype. This approach is generalizable, and we anticipate that the extension of pooled CRISPR screens into the noncoding genome will provide further insights and methods for unbiased interrogation of the genome.Sanjana et al.Page 4Science.
