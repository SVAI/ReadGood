Merlin Is a Potent Inhibitor of Glioma GrowthYing-Ka Ingar Lau1, Lucas B. Murray1, Sean S. Houshmandi2, Yin Xu1, David H.Gutmann2, and Qin Yu11Department of Oncological Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York2Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MissouriAbstractNeurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an inherited cancer syndrome in which affected individuals developnervous system tumors, including schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. The NF2 proteinmerlin (or schwannomin) is a member of the Band 4.1 superfamily of proteins, which serve as linkersbetween transmembrane proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. In addition to mutational inactivationof the NF2 gene in NF2-associated tumors, mutations and loss of merlin expression have also beenreported in other types of cancers. In the present study, we show that merlin expression is dramaticallyreduced in human malignant gliomas and that reexpression of functional merlin dramatically inhibitsboth subcutaneous and intracranial growth of human glioma cells in mice. We further show thatmerlin reexpression inhibits glioma cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in vivo. Usingmicroarray analysis, we identify altered expression of specific molecules that play key roles in cellproliferation, survival, and motility. These merlin-induced changes of gene expression wereconfirmed by real-time quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and functional assays. These resultsindicate that reexpression of merlin correlates with activation of mammalian sterile 20-like 1/2–largetumor suppressor 2 signaling pathway and inhibition of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signals.Collectively, our results show that merlin is a potent inhibitor of high-grade human glioma.IntroductionThe most common brain tumor in adults is high-grade glial neoplasm, termed malignant glioma(1). Despite advances in neurosurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis ofmalignant glioma remains dismal, with an estimated median survival of <1 year (2). With theemergence of biologically target-based therapies, it is important to identify new therapeutictargets and to develop novel targeted treatments to battle this deadly disease. Insights into thepathogenesis of gliomas are likely to arise from the study of inherited cancer syndromes, inwhich affected individuals are prone to the development of glial malignancies. One of thesedisorders is neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Patients with NF2 develop schwannomas,meningiomas, and ependymomas, an uncommon type of glioma (3).The NF2 gene shares sequence similarity with the members of Band 4.1 superfamily (4,5). Inparticular, the NF2 protein, merlin (or schwannomin), most closely resembles proteins of theezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) subfamily. Similar to the ERM proteins, merlin serves as a linker©2008 American Association for Cancer Research.Requests for reprints: Qin Yu, 16-20A-Icahn, 1425 Madison Ave, Department of Oncological Sciences, Mount Sinai School ofMedicine, New York, NY 10029.

Unlike ERM proteins, merlin functions as a negative growthregulator or tumor suppressor. In this regard, mutational inactivation of the NF2 gene issufficient to result in the development of NF2-associated nervous system tumors. Moreover,NF2 mutations have also been reported in other tumor types, including melanoma andmesothelioma (9), suggesting that merlin plays an important role, not only in NF2-associatedtumors but also in sporadic cancers.Merlin has a conserved trilobe NH2 terminal FERM (the band four-point-one/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain, a central α-helical region, and an extended COOH terminal tail (4,5). Merlinis capable of forming head-to-tail intramolecular and intermolecular association, and the head-to-tail closed conformation is required for the tumor suppressor activity (10,11).Phosphorylation of Ser518 at the COOH terminus results in an open conformation, whichinactivates the tumor suppressor activity of merlin.Whereas numerous studies have examined the role of merlin in schwannomas andmeningiomas, comparatively little is known about the function of merlin in glial cell tumors.In the present study, we show, for the first time, that merlin expression is dramatically reducedin high-grade human malignant gliomas. Furthermore, reexpression of merlin inhibits thegrowth of human glioma cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas NF2 knockdown promotes gliomagrowth in vivo. Lastly, using microarray analyses and subsequent validation and functionalassays, we show that merlin positively regulates the large tumor suppressor 2 (Lats2) signalingpathway and down-regulates canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling. The demonstrationthat merlin is a critical negative regulator of glioma growth coupled with the identification ofnovel downstream effectors will provide new targets for the development of future brain tumortreatments.Materials and MethodsPatient samplesThe glioma tissue microarray was assembled at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, andadditional tumor samples were obtained from the Washington University/Siteman CancerCenter Tumor Tissue Repository, as previously described (12). Human tissues were used inaccordance with approved Human Studies Protocols.Cell lines and reagentsHuman glioma cells, M089J, U138MG, DBRG05MG, LN229, M059K, Hs683, LN18, LN229,and A172 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); SNB19,U373MG, SF763, U251, SF268, SF539, U343MG, SF188, SF295, SF797, SNB75, SF126,SF210, U118MG, and U87MG and rat glioma cell 9L were obtained from University ofCalifornia-San Francisco and National Cancer Institute (NCI). Normal human astrocytes (NHAcells) were obtained from ALLCELLS, Inc. Cells were maintained following the providers’and manufacturers’ instructions. Anti-v5 epitope (Invitrogen), anti-merlin (Santa Cruz), anti–mammalian sterile 20-like 1/2 (MST1/2; Bethyl Laboratories), anti-Lats2 (BethylLaboratories), anti–Yes-associated protein (YAP; Abnova), anti–cellular inhibitor of apoptosis1/2 (cIAP1/2; Santa Cruz), anti-actin (Sigma), anti–phosphorylated MST1/2 (Cell Signaling),anti–phosphorylated Lats2 (Abnova), and anti–phosphorylated YAP (Cell Signaling) wereused in the experiments. 5-Bromo-2’-deoxy-uridine (BrdUrd) cell proliferation kit (Roche),Apoptag kit (Chemicon), and RhoA pull-down kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) were also used.Lau et al.Page 2Cancer Res.

Wild-type merlin and themerlin mutants together with their COOH terminal v5-epitope tags were cloned into theretroviral expression vector pQCXIP (BD Bioscience; ref. 13). Retroviruses were generatedusing these expression constructs and pVSVG/ GP2 293 cells following the manufacturer’sinstructions (BD Bioscience). All expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.To knockdown merlin expression, several shRNAmir constructs against human merlin and anontargeting shRNAmir control construct were obtained from Open Biosystems. Lentivirusescarrying these short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) were generated following the manufacturer’sinstructions.Lentivirus and retrovirus transductionU87MG and U251 human glioma cells were first transduced with retroviruses carryingluciferase and a hygromycin-resistant gene and then transduced with retroviruses carrying theempty retroviral expression vector, wild-type merlin, or merlin mutants. RNA knockdown wasaccomplished using lentiviruses carrying shRNAs against merlin and a nontargeting controlshRNA following the manufacturer’s instructions. Infected cells were selected for theirresistance to hygromycin and puromycin. Anti-v5 monoclonal antibody (mAb; Invitrogen) wasused to detect exogenous merlin, whereas anti-merlin antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used forendogenous merlin.Expression profiling and real-time quantitative PCRTo compare gene expression profiles, we used human U133v2 gene chips (Affymetrix) andthe probes derived from three independently transduced and pooled puromycin-resistantU87MG cells that reexpress merlin (U87MGmerlin) or were transduced with empty retroviruses(U87MGwt) following standard protocols at the University of Pennsylvania MicroarrayFacility. Probe intensity data were imported to ArrayAssist Lite version 3.4 (Stratagene), andexpression values for the probe sets were calculated using GCRMA. Affymetrix Absent,Marginal, and Present (A, M, P) scoring designations were also included. The data were thenimported back to GeneSpringGX version 7.3.1 (Agilent) and filtered based on P in at least twoof six samples. Finally, SAM version 2.2.1 (Stanford University) was applied using a two-classunpaired analysis, and differentially expressed genes were identified using a fold change cutoffof > 1.5 and a false discovery rate of <5%.For patient sample analysis, cDNAs were prepared from 1µg total RNA. Real-time quantitativePCR (qPCR) was performed and analyzed as previously described (12). In addition, total RNAsfrom U87MGmerlin and U87MGwt cells were isolated using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). cDNAswere generated using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription–PCR(Invitrogen). Primers for real-time qPCR were designed according to the Primer Bank Program(Massachusetts General Hospital3). qPCR was performed by using SYBR Green PCR MasterMix (Roche) and the Chromo4 real-time PCR Machine (Bio-Rad). The cycling variables usedwere 95°C for 8 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C (15 s), 60°C (30s), and 72°C (30 s) and amelting curve analysis. Relative quantification of the targets were normalized with anendogenous housekeeping gene (TATA-box binding protein), and data analyses wereperformed using a comparative (ΔΔCt) method using manufacturer’s software and accordingto manufacturer’s instructions.3http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/index.htmlLau et al.Page 3Cancer Res.

Forthe immunocytochemical analyses, glioma cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes for 24 h andfixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were then washed with PBS and blocked with 2%bovine serum albumin. Antibodies against v5-epitope or merlin were used to detect theappropriate antigens.Soft agar colony formation assaysTo perform anchorage-independent growth assays, six-well plates were first covered with alayer of 0.6% agar made in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) DMEM and the pooled populationof transduced U87MG cells (1 × 105 per well) in 0.3% agar (in DMEM) were seeded on topof the 0.6% agar layer and incubated in a humidified chamber for 3 wk. The six-well plateswere inspected, and 30 randomly selected fields were photographed under a 2.5× microscopiclens and a 10× optical lens (25× magnification). Colonies were then counted, and the meannumber of colonies per field was calculated. All experiments were done in triplicate.Transwell tumor cell invasion assayTumor cell invasion assays were performed using Transwell chambers with 8-µm pores(Costar) that were coated with a layer of Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical). DMEMcontaining 10% FBS was added to the lower chambers of the Transwells. Transduced U87MGcells (2 × 105 per well) were seeded on the top of the Transwell in triplicate and incubated for24 h. The bottom filters were fixed and stained at the end of the experiments. Cells in the topchambers were removed by wiping with cotton swabs, and the stained cells that had migratedthrough the Matrigel were counted under a microscope. Thirty randomly selected 100×microscopic fields were counted.Apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drug and irradiationTransduced U87MG cells were cultured with different concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)(0, 5, or 50 µmol/L; Sigma) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After the incubation period, thefloating and adherent cells were harvested for apoptosis detection (n = 6).4 × 106 transduced U87MG cells were irradiated by γ-radiation at a dose rate of 2.78 Gy/minand divided into sets that received 0, 5, 10, or 20 Gy of total irradiation. Irradiated cells werereplated into culture dishes and incubated at 37°C for 2 d before harvest (n = 6).Detection of apoptosisCollected cells were lysed, diluted to 104 cells/mL in lysis buffer, and assayed for apoptosisusing the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche), according to the manufacturer’sinstructions.Luciferase reporter assayTo measure canonical Wnt signaling in U87MGwt and U87MGmerlinS518D, U87MGmerlin, andU87MGmerlinS518A cells, we used the β-catenin–responsive luciferase reporter construct(TopFlash, Addgene), which contains T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor (TCF/LEF)binding sites and a negative control construct, FopFlash, which contains mutated TCF/LEFbinding sites. These reporters were transfected transiently into these transduced glioma cellsin triplicate. The luciferase activity in these transfected cells were measured 24 hposttransfection following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega) using a ModulusMicroplate Luminometer/Fluorometer (Turner Biosystems).Lau et al.Page 4Cancer Res.

Briefly, 1 × 106 glioma cells were injected into eachimmunocompromised B6.129S7-Rag1tmMom (Rag1, Jackson Laboratories) mouse. Six micewere used for each type of the infected glioma cell lines. After solid tumors became visible(10–15 d after the injection), the longest and shortest diameters of the solid tumors weremeasured using a digital caliper every third day for 5 to 7 wk. Tumor volumes were calculatedusing the following formula: tumor volume = 1 / 2 × (shortest diameter)2 × longest diameter(mm3). At the end of the experiments, tumors were fixed and sectioned for the histologic andimmunologic analyses.Transduced U87MG and U251 cells were also used for the intracranial tumor growthexperiments. U87MG (2 × 105cells in 10 µL HBSS/Rag1 mouse)/U251 cells (1 × 105cells in10 µL HBSS/Rag1 mouse) were stereotactically injected at the bregma 2 mm to the right ofthe sagittal suture and 3 mm below the surface of the skull. After injection, mice were closelymonitored and the duration of their survival was recorded. Mice that showed signs of morbiditywere euthanized and considered as if they had died on that day, and the number of survivingmice was recorded. The survival rates were calculated as follows: survival rate (%) = (numberof mice still alive / total number of experimental mice) × 100%. At the end of the experiments,the mouse brains were removed, fixed, and sectioned for histologic analysis. Mice that werefree of symptoms 60 d after intracranial injection were euthanized and examined.Bioluminescence imaging analysis of the intracranial gliomasTo monitor the growth of intracranial gliomas in living animal, we used bioluminescenceimaging approach. We infected U87MG and U251 cells with a retroviral-based luciferaseexpression vector that also contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the hygromycinresistance gene. Hygromycin-resistant U87MG and U251 cells express a high level ofluciferase (data not shown). These cells were then infected with retroviruses carrying the emptyretroviral expression vector containing puromycin-resistant gene alone (U87MG/U251-Lucwt) or containing wild-type merlin (U87MG/U251-Lucmerlin), merlinS518A (U87MG/U251-LucmerlinS518A), or merlinS518D (U87MG/U251-LucmerlinS518D). These double drug-resistant cells expressed high levels of luciferase and/or wt merlin/merlin mutant and were usedfor intracranial injection into Rag-1 mice. At 4, 10, and 16 d after the injections,bioluminescence images of the intracranial tumors were acquired by using IVIS-200 imagingsystem (Xenogen) at In vivo Molecular Imaging Shared Facility (Mount Sinai School ofMedicine).Histology and immunohistochemistryTo determine the tumor cell proliferation rate in vivo, BrdUrd was injected i.p. into mice 4 hbefore euthanasia. Gliomas were removed, fixed, sectioned, and stained with H&E as described(13). In addition, the sections were reacted with anti-BrdUrd antibodies to detect proliferatingcells or with the Apoptag kit to detect apoptotic cells in situ (14).StatisticsOther than the survival experiments, Student’s t test was used to analyze statistical differencesbetween the control and experimental groups. For the mouse survival experiments, log-rankstatistical analysis (SigmaStat) was used to calculate the statistical differences between controland experimental groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.Lau et al.Page 5Cancer Res.

We assessed the level of merlinexpression in 23 human GBM tissues by Western blot and real-time qPCR analyses. Proteinlysates from these 23 GBM samples were analyzed by Western blot using anti-merlin antibody(Santa Cruz; C-18), and merlin expression levels were determined by scanning densitometry(Gel-Pro). We observed more than a 2-fold reduction of merlin expression in 14 of 23 GBMtumors relative to normal brain (61%; Fig. 1A) and more than a 4-fold reduction in six tumors(26%; Fig. 1A). Real-time qPCR analysis of merlin RNA from the same 23 samples, as wellas two normal brain (NB) and NHA samples, showed that, compared with NB and NHA cells,there is a >2-fold reduction of merlin RNA expression in 15 of 23 GBM tumors (65%; Fig.1B) and more than a 4-fold reduction in 6 of these 23 samples (26%; Fig. 1B). The remainingtumors showed <2-fold decreases in merlin expression. Together, we found a 93% concordancebetween loss of merlin RNA and protein expression in these GBM tumors. In addition, usinga glioma tissue microarray stained with NF2 (C-18) antibody, we observed that merlinexpression was absent in 27.4% of the GBM tumors (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, we did not observeany reduction in merlin expression in anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade 3 tumors),suggesting that loss of merlin is associated with grade 4 glioma (GBM).Establishment of human glioma cells that overexpress merlin and merlin mutantsTo assess the potential role of merlin in glioma growth, we first analyzed the level of merlinexpression in a variety of human glioma cell lines. In general, human glioma cell lines, suchas U87MG, U251, SF763, and SF767 that are capable of forming subcutaneous and/orintracranial tumors in immunodeficient Rag-1 mice, expressed lower levels of merlin and/ora phosphorylated/inactive form of merlin (lanes 12 and 20, the upper band of the double bands).In contrast, NHAs and the nontumorigenic or low tumorigenic human glioma cell lines, suchas M089J, Hs683, LN18, SNB19, SF295, and SF210, expressed higher levels of merlin (Fig.2A).U87MG and U251 cells which express very low or intermediate levels of endogenous merlin,respectively, were infected with retroviruses containing the empty retroviral expression vector(U87MG/U251wt), wild-type merlin (U87MG/U251merlin), merlin S518A mutant (U87MG/U251merlinS518A), or merlinS518D mutant (U87MG/U251merlinS518D). The S518A mutationresults in a non-phosphorylatable form of merlin that is constitutively active, whereasmerlinS518D mimics a phosphorylated and inactive form of merlin (10,11,15). The retroviralexpression vectors used also contain an IRES positioned between the cDNA inserts and thepuromycin resistance gene, so that all the puromycin-resistant cells should express merlin orthe merlin mutants. After selection of the infected cells with puromycin, the pooled drug-resistant cells were found to express high levels of merlin or the merlin mutants (Fig. 2B andSupplementary Fig. S1; data not shown). Glioma cells expressing exogenous merlin andmerlinS518A, but not merlin S518D, displayed an altered morphology that is characterized byextended cellular processes and a reduced transformation phenotype (Fig. 2C; data not shown).Merlin reexpression inhibits anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness of gliomacells and sensitizes glioma cells to chemotherapy and irradiationTo determine how merlin affects the cellular behavior of glioma cells, we first investigated theeffect of merlin on anchorage-independent growth of U87MG cells by assessing the ability ofthese transduced glioma cells to form colonies in soft agar. We found that U87MGwt andU87MGmerlinS518D cells readily formed large colonies in soft agar and that merlin andLau et al.Page 6Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptmerlinS518A reexpression dramatically reduced the number and size of the colonies (Fig. 3A),suggesting that active, but not inactive, merlin inhibits anchorage-independent growth. Thisresult is consistent with our previous findings (13). We then determined the effect of merlinon glioma cell invasion. Similarly, active, but not inactive, merlin inhibits invasiveness of theseglioma cells (Fig. 3B).Glioblastomas are often chemoresistant and radioresistant as a result of constitutive activationand/or induced activation of several distinct signaling pathways, including thephosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway (16,17). We examined the ability ofmerlin to sensitize glioma cells to 5-FU and irradiation. We found that reexpression of merlinsensitized U87MG cells to 5-FU and irradiation (Fig. 3C and D). Whereas the exact mechanismunderlying the slightly reduced apoptosis rate of U87MGwt cells treated with 20Gy of irradationrelative to those treated with 5 or 10Gy is not known, high dose radiation may actually inducea higher level of activation of antiapoptotic signals in U87MGwt cells, which counteracts theapoptotic effect of high-dose radiation (16,17). Regardless, reexpression of merlin consistentlysensitizes the response of the U87 cells to radiation.Merlin inhibits U87MG and U251glioma cell subcutaneous growth by reducing proliferationand promoting apoptosis in vivoTransduced U87MG and U251 cells were used for subcutaneous tumor growth experiments toassess the effect of merlin and merlin mutants on tumor growth in vivo. We found that wild-type merlin and merlinS518A, but not merlinS518D, dramatically inhibited subcutaneousgrowth of glioma cells (Fig. 4A–C). To determine the cellular mechanism underlying this effect,we analyzed proliferation and apoptosis of the transduced U87MG cells in vivo. We observedthat reexpression of merlin and merlinS518A, but not merlinS518D, inhibited tumor cellproliferation (BrdUrd incorporation) and promoted apoptosis (terminaldeoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining) of tumor cells invivo (Fig. 4D).Merlin inhibits the intracranial growth of U87MG and U251 glioma cells, whereas knockdownof merlin promotes U251 glioma intracranial growthTo monitor intracranial tumor growth, we infected luciferase-expressing U87MG and U251cells with the retroviruses carrying the empty retroviral expression vector containingpuromycin-resistant gene alone (U87MG/U251-Lucwt), wild-type merlin (U87MG/U251-Lucmerlin), merlinS518A (U87MG/U251-LucmerlinS518A), or merlinS518D (U87MG/U251-LucmerlinS518D). Transduced U87MG cells were injected intracranially into Rag-1 mice, andtumor growth was studied using the IVIS-200 imaging system (Xenogen; Fig. 5A). As seenwith the subcutaneous explants, wild-type merlin and merlinS518A, but not merlinS518D,expression in either U87MG (Fig. 5B) or U251 (Fig. 5D) significantly increased the survivalof the experimental mice. Importantly, a large fraction of these mice only had nonsymptomaticsmall tumors 40 days after intracranial injection. In contrast, the mean survival of the mice thatreceived U87MG/U251-Lucwt and U87MG/U251-LucmerlinS518D cells was <3 to 4 weeks (Fig.5B and D).Unlike U87MG cells, which express very low levels of endogenous merlin (Fig. 2A, lane 6,arrow), U251 cells express intermediate levels of endogenous merlin (Fig. 2A, lane 13,arrow). Accordingly, U87MG cells grow more aggressively than U251 cells in vivo (Fig. 4and Fig 5). To determine whether knockdown expression of endogenous merlin in U251 gliomacells promotes tumor growth, we screened a set of shRNAmir constructs against human merlin.A nontargeting shRNA construct was used as a negative control. The lentiviruses carryingthese shRNA constructs were used to infect U251-Luc cells. We found that two of the threeshRNAmir constructs (mer-shRNA#1 and mer-shRNA#3, Open Biosystems) reduced merlinLau et al.Page 7Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptexpression by ~70%, whereas the nontargeting control construct had no effect on merlinexpression (Fig. 5C). We then assessed tumorigenicity of the pooled U251-Lucwt, U251-Lucmer-shRNA#1, U251-Lucmer-shRNA#3, and U251-LuccontrolshRNA cells by injecting thesecells intracranially into Rag1 mice. Consistent with our reexpression studies, knockdown ofmerlin expression in U251 cells increased intracranial glioma growth and reduced overallsurvival of these mice (Fig. 5D).Transcript profiling of U87MGmerlin cells suggests that merlin is a master regulator of severalimportant signaling pathwaysTo identify potential downstream targets of merlin glioma growth inhibition, we comparedgene expression profiles from three independently transduced and pooled puromycin-resistantU87MGmerlin and U87MGwt cells. We identified 362 genes whose expression increased and364 genes whose expression decreased in U87MGmerlin cells compared with U87MGwt cells(data not shown). These genes were then imported to David Functional AnnotationBioinformatics Microarray Analysis software4 (NIAID/NIH) to enrich for functionally relatedgene groups affected by merlin expression. After classification of these transcripts intofunctional pathways, we found that merlin reexpression results in increased expression oftranscripts that activate the Lats2 signaling pathway, as well as increased expression ofmolecules that inhibit canonical Wnt and RhoA signaling and decreased expression oftranscripts that activate canonical Wnt and RhoA signaling (Supplementary Table S1).Merlin activates Lats2 signaling pathway and inhibits canonical and noncanonical WntsignalingTo validate the microarray results, we performed quantitative real-time qPCR using cDNAsfrom U87MGmerlin and U87MGwt cells. The qPCR results confirmed the increased expressionof inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling (DKK-1 and DKK-3) and decreased expression of anactivator of canonical Wnt signaling (FZD1; Fig. 6A). In addition, we found that merlinreexpression reduced the expression of activators of RhoA signaling (ARHGEF3 and VAV3)and increased the expression of proteins that inhibit RhoA signaling (DLC1, ARHGAP29, andRRAD; Fig. 6A). Lastly, merlin reexpression resulted in increased expression of themammalian homologues of proteins in the Drosophila Hippo (Hpo)–Warts (Wts)–Yorkie(Yki) pathway (FAT3, MST1, MST2, Lats1, and Lats2; Fig. 6A). Taken together, these resultssuggest that merlin activates Lats2 signaling and inhibits canonical and noncanonical Wntsignaling.We next assessed these merlin-induced changes of the expression at the protein or functionallevel. Because canonical Wnt signaling regulates gene expression by modulating the levels ofβ-catenin expression, a coactivator of the TCF/LEF transcription factors, we performedreporter assays using a β-catenin–responsive luciferase reporter construct, TopFlash(Addgene). FopFlash, which contains mutated TCF/LEF binding sites, was used as a negativecontrol. We found that β-catenin transcriptional activity is inhibited by wild-type merlin andmerlinS518A, but not by merlinS518D (Fig. 6B). We then assessed RhoA activity inU87MGwt and U87MGmerlin cells using a commercially available RhoA activity assay(Cytoskeleton, Inc.). We found that RhoA activity was reduced after wild-type merlinreexpression (data not shown).We then used Western blotting to determine the activity and expression of several componentsof the Lats2 signaling cascade. Activation was assessed using phosphorylated-specificantibodies. We found that merlin reexpression resulted in increased phosphorylation of4http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jspLau et al.Page 8Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptMST1/2, Lats2, and YAP (Fig. 6D), whereas the levels of cIAP1/2 expression were reduced(Fig. 6D). These results show that merlin activates MST-Lats signaling in human glioma cells.DiscussionThe NF2 gene is a critical tumor suppressor for several distinct cell types in the nervous system,including Schwann and leptomeningeal cells, such that Nf2 inactivation in Schwann cellprecursors and leptomeningeal cells is sufficient for schwannoma and meningioma formationin mice, respectively. Because glial cell tumors (e.g., ependymomas) arise in patients withNF2, we postulated that merlin might also function as a negative growth regulator for glial celltumors. In this study, we show for the first time that merlin expression at both the RNA andprotein levels is decreased in sporadic glioblastoma tumors and malignant glioma cell lines.Moreover, we show that increased expression of merlin suppresses glioma cell growth invitro and glioma tumor growth in vivo and that merlin knockdown promotes glioma tumorgrowth in vivo. Collectively, these findings suggest that merlin might be an important growthregulator in high-grade glioma and expand the role of the NF2 gene in the pathogenesis ofcentral nervous system tumors. NF2 loss in GBM tumors is unlikely to result from mutationalinactivation, in light of previous studies examining gliomas for NF2 gene mutations (18).Moreover, we did not find reduced merlin expression in low-grade gliomas5 or in WHO grade3 gliomas, suggesting that reduced NF2 expression might be a hallmark of grade 4 glioma.In addition to its function as a potent negative growth regulator, we show that merlin alsosensitizes glioma cells to 5-FU chemotherapy and irradiation. We show that merlinreexpression increased the response of U87MG cells to 5-FU. High-grade gliomas are oftenchemoresistant and radioresistant as a result of constitutive activation and/or induced activationof several distinct signaling pathways, including the PI3K signaling pathways (16,17).Irradiation activates PI3K pathway in human gliomas (16,17). In light of published reports inother tumor types (19,20), it is interesting to note that merlin reexpression results in decreasedexpression of two members of the cIAP family, cIAP1 and cIAP2. cIAP1 and cIAP2 have beenshown to directly bind to and inhibit caspase activity (21), which underlies the prosurvivaleffect of IAP proteins. Studies have shown that both cIAP1 and cIAP2 are up-regulated inGBM tumors compared with normal brain tissue (data derived from ref. 22), suggesting apossible mechanism underlying the relative resistance of GBM tumors to chemotherapy andradiation.In our studies, U87MGwt cells treated with 20 Gy of irradiation showed reduced apoptosisrelative to U87MG cells treated with 5 or 10Gy. Whereas these findings seem contradictory,high-dose radiation may actually induce a higher level of activation of antiapoptotic signals inU87MGwt cells, which counteracts the apoptotic effect of high-dose radiation (16,17).Regardless, reexpression of merlin consistently sensitizes the response of U87MG cells toradiation.Numerous studies have focused on defining the mechanism underlying merlin tumorsuppressor activity and identified several distinct growth regulatory pathways. One of thesepathways includes the Rac1 signaling pathway. Merlin overexpression inhibits Rac1-mediatedanchorage-independent growth (23) and inhibits the activity of the p21-activated kinase 1(11). Related to this mechanism, a recent study showed that a GTP-binding protein (termedthe NF2-associated GTP-binding protein) interacts with merlin and may regulate theantiproliferative activity of merlin by interfering with small GTPase protein signaling (24). Inaddition, other investigators have shown that merlin may regulate mitogen-activated proteinkinase, Akt, and c-Jun NH2 kinase signaling (15,25).5S.S. Houshmandi and D.H.

To gaininsights into the potential mechanism(s) responsible for merlin-negative regulation of braintumor (GBM) growth, we performed RNA expression profiling. Our study revealed that merlinreexpression resulted in activation of the Lats signaling pathway and inhibition of canonicalWnt and non-canonical Wnt/RhoA signaling. These findings suggest that merlin may serve tointegrate several signaling pathways important for cell growth, apoptosis, and motility inglioma cells.In Drosophila, merlin (mer) inactivating mutations result in reduced apoptosis and increasedcell proliferation, which led to the discovery that mer functions upstream of the Hpo-Wts-Ykipathway (26–29). In flies, FAT, a large protocadherin, functions upstream of merlin. Merlinactivates Hpo kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates Wts kinase. Wtsphosphorylates and inactivates Yki and blocks its proproliferation and antiapoptotic activity(26–31). Yki, a transcriptional coactivator, regulates the expression of a common set ofdownstream target genes, including wingless (wg), DIAP, and cyclin E (26–31).The mammalian homologues of Hpo, Wts, Yki, DIAP, and wg are MST kinase 1/2 2 (32),Lats1/2 (33,34), YAP (35), cIAP1/2, and the Wnt family proteins. MST1 and MST2 canphosphorylate and activate Lats1 and Lats2 (36). Like MST1/2 genes, Lats1/2 genes encodeserine/threonine kinases and display antitumor activity (37–39). Lats1 and Lats2 are down-regulated in human astrocytomas through hypermethylation of their promoters (40). On thecontrary, YAP is amplified in human cancers and displays oncogenic activity (35,41). As atranscriptional coactivator, YAP promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by up-regulating expression of cyclin E and cIAP1/2, respectively (28). Although it is unknownwhether the entire FAT-Hpo-Wts-Yki signaling pathway is conserved in mammalian cells, likeYki, YAP rescues the pupal lethality caused by overexpression of hpo or wts in Drosophila(28). Similarly, human homologues of hpo and wts rescue their corresponding Drosophilamutants (42,43). In the current study, we show that merlin modulates the activity and/orexpression MST1/2, Lats2, and YAP, suggesting that this pathway is conserved in glioma cellsand is regulated by merlin. Our results also suggest that merlin inhibition of glioma cellproliferation and promotion of apoptosis may reflect the increased activation of MST1/2 andLats1/2, which inhibits YAP activity, leading to reduced expression of cIAP1/2 and cyclin E(not shown).Wnt signals play essential roles in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, andmotility (44). Wnts activate the canonical pathway by binding to the FZD receptors and thelow-density lipoprotein receptor–related proteins (LRP-5 and LRP-6), which in turn activ ateβ-catenin. β-Catenin interacts with members of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors toinduce expression of the Wnt-responsive genes (45). Antagonists of the Wnt signaling pathwayinclude the members of the secreted frizzled-related protein family and the members of theDickkopf family (46). Work in Drosophila implicated Wingless (Wg) as a downstream effectorof merlin (29). Studies have shown that FDZ9 and WNT pathway are up-regulated inastrocytomas (47,48) and that DKK-1 sensitizes U87MG cells to apoptosis after alkylationagent induced DNA damage (49). Our finding that merlin reexpression in human glioma cellsdecreased FDZ1 expression, increased DKK1 and DKK3 expression, and reduced canonicalWnt activity is consistent with these observations.Collectively, we show that merlin is a potent negative growth regulator in WHO grade 4gliomas and that merlin reexpression results in decreased glioma cell growth in vitro and invivo. We further showed that merlin induce apoptosis of glioma cells potentiated bychemotherapy and radiation. Analysis of the signaling pathways revealed that merlin regulatesthe MST/LATS/YAP/cIAP pathway, a critical modulator of apoptosis, and reduces canonicalWnt and RhoA signaling, important regulators of cell proliferation and/or motility.
