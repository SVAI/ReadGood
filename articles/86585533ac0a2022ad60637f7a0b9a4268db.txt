Rasmussen1 and J. M. Friedman2Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is an autosomal dominant conditioncaused by mutations of the NF1 gene, which is located at chromosome 17q11.2. NF1 is believed to becompletely penetrant, but substantial variability in expression of features occurs. Diagnosis of NF1 is based onestablished clinical criteria. The presentation of many of the clinical features is age dependent. The average lifeexpectancy of patients with NF1 is probably reduced by 10-15 years, and malignancy is the most commoncause of death. The prevalence of clinically diagnosed NF1 ranges from 1/2,000 to 1/5,000 in most population-based studies. A wide variety of NF1 mutations has been found in patients with NF1, but no frequently recurringmutation has been identified. Most studies have not found an obvious relation between particular NF1 mutationsand the resulting clinical manifestations. The variability of the NF1 phenotype, even in individuals with the sameNF1 gene mutation, suggests that other factors are involved in determining the clinical manifestations, but thenature of these factors has not yet been determined. Laboratory testing for NF1 mutations is difficult. A proteintruncation test is commercially available, but its sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value have not beenestablished. No general, population-based molecular studies of NF1 mutations have been performed. At thistime, it appears that the benefits of population-based screening for clinical features of NF1 would not outweighthe costs of screening. Am J Epidemiol 2000;151:33-40.neurofibromatosis; neurofibromatosis 1GENEThe neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) gene is located atchromosome 17qll.2. NF1 and its protein product,neurofibromin, were characterized in 1990 (1, 2). Thegene is large, spanning 350 kilobases of genomicDNA, and contains 60 exons (3). Neurofibrominbelongs to a family of proteins that serve as negativeregulators of the ras oncogene (4). Neurofibromin isbelieved to act as a tumor suppressor, but the proteinhas other functions as well. The proposed tumor sup-pressor function is supported by the findings ofsomatic "second hit" mutations of the NF1 gene inbenign and malignant tumors from NF1 patients (5, 6).NF1 is an autosomal dominant condition with virtu-ally 100 percent penetrance by adulthood (7). About50 percent of NF1 cases result from new mutations.Germline mosaicism has been observed (8) and mustReceived for publication March 25, 1999, and accepted for publi-cation August 19, 1999.Abbreviations: NF1, neurofibrofnatosis 1; NF2, neurofibromatosis 2.'

The NF1 mutation rate isamong the highest observed in humans, with estimatesranging from about 1/7,800 to 1/23,000 gametes (7, 9).About 90 percent of new mutations occur on the pater-nally derived chromosome (10, 11). The exception islarge deletions, which are usually of maternal origin(12, 13).GENE VARIANTSAs of February 1999, the NF1 Genetic AnalysisConsortium documented more than 240 different con-stitutional NF1 mutations in its database(http://www.nf.org/nflgene/). Table 1 summarizes thetypes of mutations identified thus far. The majority ofmutations lead to a truncated protein product; onlyabout 10 percent involve amino acid substitutions, andfewer than 2 percent are 3' untranslated region muta-tions. However, it should be noted that the types ofmutations identified are largely dependent on the tech-niques used for mutation detection. This may result inan overrepresentation of mutation types that are moreeasily identified (e.g., large gene deletions) and anunderrepresentation of those that may be more difficultto identify (e.g., mutations in the 3' untranslatedregion). None of the methods used for NF1 mutationdetection are capable of identifying all mutation types.3334 Rasmussen and FriedmanTABLE 1.

Early dis-cussions of NF1 referred to the condition as "neurofi-bromatosis" and included cases of the much lessfrequent condition, neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2).However, these conditions are both clinically andgenetically distinct. The most characteristic lesions ofNF2 are bilateral schwannomas on the vestibular por-tion of the eighth cranial nerve; such tumors are rarelyseen in NF1 patients. NF2 results from mutations inthe NF2 gene on chromosome 22.Despite advances in understanding of the moleculargenetics of NF1, its diagnosis remains a clinical one,based on diagnostic criteria established by a NationalInstitutes of Health consensus conference (15, 16). Adiagnosis of NF1 by these criteria requires the pres-ence of two or more of the following: 1) six or morecaf6-au-lait macules more than 5 mm in greatest diam-eter in prepubertal individuals and more than 15 mm ingreatest diameter after puberty; 2) two or more neu-rofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma;3) freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions; 4) anoptic pathway tumor; 5) two or more Lisch nodules(iris hamartomas); 6) a distinctive osseous lesion, suchas sphenoid wing dysplasia or thinning of the cortex oflong bones (with or without pseudarthrosis); or 7) afirst-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) withNF1 diagnosed by the above criteria.Some of these features, including caf6-au-lait spots,freckling in non-sun-exposed areas, and iris Lisch nod-ules, are not of clinical significance beyond their use-fulness in making a diagnosis of NF1. Benign cuta-neous and subcutaneous neurofibromas are present innearly all patients with NF1 by adulthood, and theirnumber in an individual varies widely from only a fewto hundreds or more. While these lesions are primarilyof cosmetic significance, they may be disfiguring andresult in significant psychologic distress. In contrast,about 15 percent of individuals with NF1 have plexi-form neurofibromas (17). These tumors may extendinto contiguous tissues, causing serious functionalimpairment and even death and appear to be the site ofmalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor development.Optic pathway tumors are observed in about 20 percentof the children with NF1, but most such tumors do notcause ophthahnologic or other symptoms (18). Bonychanges, such as pseudarthrosis, appear to occur inabout 5 percent of the cases (17). Often these changesare benign; however, some patients are severelyaffected, with long-bone bowing leading to fractureand, in some cases, requiring amputation (19).Several other features are often associated with NF1,including macrocephaly, scoliosis, short stature,hypertension, and high-T2-signal-intensity lesions onmagnetic resonance imaging of the brain (16). Mostindividuals with NF1 have normal intelligence, but30-60 percent have learning disabilities (20).Individuals with NF1 also appear to be at increasedrisk for malignancy, but the magnitude of this is diffi-cult to estimate, given the paucity of epidemiologicstudies. In an investigation of a Danish cohort of 212NF1 patients followed for 42 years, a relative risk of4.0 (95 percent confidence interval: 2.8, 5.6) wasobserved for malignant neoplasms or benign centralnervous system tumors among probands. Since theprobands had been identified initially through hospi-tals and might represent a bias toward more severelyaffected cases, the relative risk was also determined foraffected relatives; this risk was 1.5 (95 percent confi-dence interval: 0.9, 2.4). The risk was greater forfemales than for males (21).Certain types of cancers occur more frequently inindividuals with NFL Malignant peripheral nervesheath tumors, often referred to as neurofibrosarcomas,are the most common malignancy occurring withincreased frequency in NFL These aggressive tumorsare relatively resistant to therapy and are often lethalAm J Epidemiol Vol. 151, No. 1, 2000NF1 Gene and Neurofibromatosis 1 35(22). Central nervous system tumors, including opticpathway tumors, other astrocytomas, ependymomas,medulloblastomas, and others, also occur more fre-quently in NF1 patients (23). In addition, individualswith NF1 have an increased risk for myeloidleukemias, with over a 200-fold relative risk forchronic myelomonocytic leukemia (24). The increasedrisk for malignancies in NF1 is compatible with thefinding that the NF1 protein serves as a down-regulatorof the ras oncogene (4). An increased risk for malig-nancy could be predicted to result from inactivation ofthis tumor suppressor function through NF1 mutation.The presentation of most NF1 features is age depen-dent. Caf6-au-lait spots may be present at birth andincrease in number in early childhood. Skinfold freck-ling is most often observed next. Neurofibromas fre-quently first appear or increase in number betweenages 10 and 20 years. Lisch nodules of the iris areoften not present in childhood but are seen in nearly alladults with NF1 (17).Prevalence of NF1For several reasons, NF1 is a difficult condition forwhich to determine an accurate prevalence number.First, the wide variability in expression means that mildcases may escape ascertainment in studies dependent onan affected individual coming to medical attention.Second, the age-dependent presentation of most NF1features means that examination of young children maymiss cases that are truly affected with the condition.Third, the increased mortality seen in individuals withNF1 (see Mortality of NF1, below) reduces the preva-lence in later adulthood. Prevalence studies are summa-rized in table 2 and suggest that NF1 is one of the mostcommon autosomal dominant conditions. The preva-lence does not appear to differ by gender. The wide vari-ation in prevalence estimates may reflect differences indiagnostic criteria and methods of case ascertainment ofthe studies; however, the variation may also representtrue differences between populations, perhaps due to afounder effect (particularly in smaller populations) orother factors. One study (25) demonstrated differencesin NF1 prevalence among various ethnic groups, with ahigher prevalence in individuals of North African andAsian origins (1/522 and 1/1,052, respectively) and alower frequency among individuals of European andNorth American backgrounds (1/1,562). These differ-ences were statistically significant, and case ascertain-ment in this study was based on a mandatory physicalTABLE 2.

The question of the true prevalence of NFland whether it differs significantly between populationswill require further study.Mortality of NF1The best available mortality data are from apopulation-based study of NFl patients living inGoteberg, Sweden (26). Adults (age 20 years andolder) with NFl were ascertained through multiplemedical specialities. The average age at the time ofascertainment was 43.6 Â± 15.4 years for the 70 patientsfollowed. Cases were followed for 12 years. Over thistime period, 22 of the 70 NFl patients died; 5.1 deathswere expected on the basis of the general Swedishpopulation. Of these 22 deaths, 13 were women andnine were men, with 1.7 and 3.4 deaths expected in thepopulations, respectively, leading the authors to sug-gest that women may be affected more than men. Thestudy showed a significantly reduced life expectancyin patients with NFl (p < 0.001), with a mean age atdeath of NFl patients of 61.6 years compared with alife expectancy in the general population of 75 years.Malignancy was the most common cause of death,occurring in 12 (55 percent) of the patients (26, 27).Hypertension significantly associated with mortality;10 of 12 patients with high blood pressure died duringthe observation period.NF1 risk factorsPaternal age has been shown to be significantlyadvanced in sporadic cases of several other autosomaldominant disorders, but whether paternal age isadvanced in sporadic cases of NFl is not clear. A studyin Texas (28) recently addressed this question. Paternalage was obtained from the birth certificates of cases(identified as NFl patients seen in two specialty neu-rofibromatosis clinics) and birth certificates of controls(two per case, chosen at random from the same year andcounty of birth). Fathers of NFl patients were 1.5 yearsolder than were fathers of controls at the birth of thechild, but this difference was not statistically significant(p = 0.07) (28). It appears that the paternal age effect insporadic cases of NFl is either small or nonexistent.ASSOCIATIONSNFl is the condition most commonly associatedwith NFl gene mutations. For NFl, the penetrance isbelieved to be virtually 100 percent by adulthood (29);that is, individuals with an NFl gene mutation haveclinical manifestations of NFl, usually by age 6 years.Most studies have not found an obvious relationbetween particular NFl mutations and resulting clini-cal manifestations in a patient. However, attempts atgenotype-phenotype correlation in NFl are con-founded by the effect of age, which increases the fre-quency of disease manifestations and the likelihood ofserious complications in all patients. In addition, thereis no consensus regarding how to define NFl severity.Some studies of patients with large NFl gene dele-tions indicate that they may have earlier onset of cuta-neous neurofibromas and more often have dysmorphicfacial features and mental retardation than do mostNFl patients (13, 30, 31). However, not all NFlpatients with this phenotype have a large gene deletion(32), and some with large gene deletions have an unre-markable NFl phenotype (33), raising questions aboutthis genotype-phenotype relation. The presence of amore severe phenotype may be a function of theamount of flanking DNA involved in the deletionrather than of the NFl gene deletion itself.Certain variants of NFl have been associated eitherwith specific NFl mutations or with linkage to theNFl gene, at least in some cases. These includeWatson syndrome (characterized by pulmonic steno-sis, caf6-au-lait spots, short stature, and cognitiveimpairment) (34, 35); familial multiple caf6-au-laitspots (without other NFl features) (36-38); familialspinal neurofibromatosis (characterized by spinaltumors and, sometimes, caf6-au-lait spots, but not byother features of NFl) (39, 40); and encephalocranio-cutaneous lipomatosis (characterized by unilaterallipomatous growths, ipsilateral ophthalmologic andbrain malformations, mental retardation, and seizures)(41). It appears that these variants may be allelic toNFl, at least in some families.Patients with segmental neurofibromatosis have fea-tures of NFl confined to a particular area of the body(e.g., one side of the body) (42). While it has been pos-tulated that segmental neurofibromatosis results froma somatic mutation in the NFl gene, this postulate hasnot yet been molecularly demonstrated. Somaticmosaicism for the NFl gene has been reported in atleast four cases (33, 43-45), but all of these casesshowed typical NFl, suggesting that the somatic muta-tion occurred early in embryonic development.Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condi-tion characterized by webbing of the neck, unusualfacies, short stature, and congenital heart disease (oftenpulmonic stenosis). Features of Noonan syndrome,often without a cardiovascular malformation, havebeen observed in many patients with NFl. About 13percent of patients with NFl specifically examined forNoonan syndrome features had a Noonan syndromephenotype (46); this frequency of co-occurrence seemsAm J Epidemiol Vol. 151, No. 1, 2000NF1 Gene and Neurofibromatosis 1 37unlikely if NFl and Noonan syndrome are independentdisorders. In some families, NFl and Noonan syn-drome have been shown to segregate as independentautosomal dominant traits, and Noonan syndrome isnot linked to the NFl locus in families without featuresof NFl. In other instances, features of both Noonansyndrome and NFl appear to result from mutations ofthe NFl gene, and these phenotypes segregate together(46). It appears that the concurrence of NFl andNoonan syndrome may have several different causes(47), but this question awaits further study.NFl and the associated clinical presentations dis-cussed above are the only conditions known to becaused by NFl gene mutations. No studies of the NFlgene in the general population have been performed.INTERACTIONSThe wide variability of the NFl phenotype, even inindividuals with the same NFl gene mutation, sug-gests that other factors are involved in determiningclinical manifestations. These may include other mod-ifying genes, environmental factors, and chance. Thusfar, little is known about the relative contribution ofthese to the NFl phenotype.A study of 175 individuals in 48 families, includingsix monozygotic twin pairs, evaluated variation of theNFl phenotype with degree of relation (48). The num-ber of caf6-au-lait spots and of neurofibromas showeda high correlation between monozygotic twins, a lowercorrelation between first-degree relatives, and the low-est correlation among more distant relatives. The studyalso looked at the presence or absence of plexiformneurofibromas, optic gliomas, scoliosis, epilepsy, andreferral for remedial education. With the exception ofplexiform neurofibromas, these traits also showedfamilial clustering. The authors concluded that muchof the phenotypic variation in NFl is related to trait-specific "modifying genes."It has been suggested that environmental factorsinfluence NFl phenotype; however, no convincingevidence has been presented to support the involve-ment of any particular environmental factor. Riccardi(49) has suggested that mechanical trauma (in the formof injury to the skin) may often precede the develop-ment of neurofibromas, but the evidence for involve-ment of this factor is anecdotal.The role of stochastic factors (chance) in the occur-rence of some NFl manifestations has also beenhypothesized. Chance may be involved in determiningwhich cells are affected by a somatic mutation and atwhat point in development somatic mutation occurs.Major questions remain about how the NFl phenotypeis determined, but it is likely that the NFl genotype,modifying genes, environmental factors, and chanceall play a role in the clinical manifestations of NFlgene mutations.LABORATORY TESTSLaboratory testing for NFl mutations is difficult.Although a variety of approaches has been used singlyor in combination in research laboratories, none hasbeen shown to be appropriate for routine clinical use.A protein truncation test is available commercially forNFl mutation testing, but its sensitivity, specificity, andpositive predictive value in a large group of patientshave not been reported. In this test, RNA is reverse tran-scribed, and the complementary DNA product is used toperform in vitro transcription and translation. Truncatedneurofibromin proteins are identified by separating theprotein products using an sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gel (50). Mutations may then be confirmedby direct DNA sequencing. False-positive results arepossible when truncated proteins are not confirmed bysequencing (16). In addition, the protein truncation testcannot detect mutations that do not result in a truncatedprotein, such as missense mutations and large deletions,or mutations in which the RNA is unstable and, thus, isunavailable for reverse transcription. The ability of theprotein truncation test to detect mosaic mutations isunknown (16). However, it appears that the risk for bothfalse positives (when a finding of a truncated protein isnot confirmed by DNA sequencing) and false negativesmay be significant with this test. Published studies of thesensitivity of the protein truncation test have been small;about 70 percent of the cases meeting NFl diagnosticcriteria (13 of 20 cases in one study (50) and 11 of 15cases in another (51)) had a positive result on the proteintruncation test Thirty-seven (77 percent) of 48 cases thatmet NFl diagnostic criteria referred for commercial test-ing are reported to have had a positive protein truncationtest result (T. Brown, LabCorp, Research Triangle Park,North Carolina, personal communication, 1999). Noinformation is available on the specificity or positivepredictive value of the protein truncation test. When theprotein truncation test is negative, further molecularstudies may be helpful in identifying the mutation, butthese studies are currently available only on a researchbasis.In familial NFl cases (when two or more family mem-bers are affected), linkage analysis can be performed.The availability of intragenic microsatellite NFl markershas increased the proportion of families in which linkagestudies will be informative and has also increased thediagnostic accuracy (52) to an average of 90 percent.Given that NFl is easily diagnosed clinically inmost affected individuals over age 6 years, the need forlaboratory testing is limited to specific circumstances.One of these is for prenatal diagnosis when one of theAm J Epidemiol Vol. 151, No. 1, 200038 Rasmussen and Friedmanparents has NFL If the causative mutation has beenidentified, direct testing for this specific mutation canbe performed on chorionic villus or amniotic fluidsamples. However, the severity of NF1 cannot be pre-dicted prenatally; only the presence or absence of themutation can be identified. Because of the wide vari-ability in NF1 clinical expression, many families donot find prenatal diagnosis of NF1 acceptable (16).In families in which there are multiple affected rela-tives, linkage analysis can also be used for prenataldiagnosis. Once again, only the presence or absence ofthe affected allele can be predicted, not the severity ofthe clinical manifestations.The other situation in which laboratory testing maybe considered is in children at risk for NF1, beforeclinical diagnostic criteria are met. The child may be atrisk because of a family history or because of havingsome features (typically caf6-au-lait spots), but notsufficient features to meet the established diagnosticcriteria. While the ability to confirm or rule out thediagnosis with a laboratory test would be helpful, thesechildren are at particular risk for possible stigmatiza-tion and unnecessary medical intervention if a false-positive test results (16). Therefore, following thechild on a regular basis for appearance of NF1 compli-cations and sufficient clinical criteria to assure thediagnosis is likely to be a better option at this time.POPULATION TESTINGNo general, population-based studies using moleculartesting to identify NF1 mutations have been performed.This type of study seems unnecessary since individualsover age 6 years with NF1 mutations can usually beidentified by physical and ophthalmologic examination.Clinical methods of NF1 ascertainment have beenperformed to estimate the prevalence of the conditionin research studies in different populations (seePrevalence of NF1, above). However, population-based screening of individuals for clinical features ofNF1 has not received substantial support. This is, inpart, due to the difficulty of the effort: Careful physi-cal examination for NF1 features is time consuming,unlike other population-based screening methodsbased on a simple laboratory test. In addition, sincemany NF1 features are age dependent, diagnosis in achild under age 3 years is often challenging. However,most adult individuals with NF1 can be identified as aresult of a regular physical examination, even in theabsence of a screening program.An important question is whether an early NF1 diag-nosis, achieved through a screening program, wouldlead to prevention of NF1 complications. Since pri-mary prevention of NF1 complications is not presentlypossible, this beneficial effect would be confined to thepossibility that early recognition of complications mayresult in improved treatment. Several studies haveassessed whether screening of individuals alreadyknown to have NF1 for complications is helpful. Arecent paper suggests that the vast majority of abnor-malities identified through a comprehensive screeningprogram (consisting of ophthalmologic consultationwith slit-lamp examination, chest radiograph, abdomi-nal ultrasonography, neuroimaging, and analysis ofcatecholamine levels) did not result in therapeuticaction (53). Studies such as these have led many NF1experts to suggest that a careful clinical evaluation forNF1 complications on an annual basis (or more often,if necessary) by a physician familiar with NF1 is opti-mal for affected individuals (16). Regular ophthalmo-logic examination is also recommended for childrenwith NF1 (18). Unfortunately, no studies are availablethat address the more general question of whether anearlier NF1 diagnosis, made through a screening pro-gram, would lead to improved treatment.Another valid concern when considering whether apopulation-based screening program may be beneficialis the effect that early diagnosis may have on familyplanning (avoidance of future pregnancies or utilizationof prenatal diagnosis). In a recent survey, the majorityof parents preferred an early diagnosis of NF1 in theirchild; however, NF1 diagnosis did not usually result inavoidance of future pregnancies, and while prenataldiagnosis was viewed favorably, only a few parentssaid they would actually terminate an affected preg-nancy (54). All of these issues will need to be taken intoaccount in the discussion regarding population-basedscreening (whether using molecular methods or clinicalmethods); however, at this time, it appears that the ben-efits of early diagnosis do not outweigh the potentialcosts of a population-based screening program.REFERENCES1.
