Growth and proliferation signaling in human VS tumorigenesis may play akey role in molecular therapeutic targeting. VS carry mutations of the NF2 gene encoding thetumor suppressor, merlin, which interacts with ErbB2 in Schwann cells, implicating ErbBreceptors in VS tumorigenesis. ErbB receptor family members are overexpressed or constitutivelyactivated in many human tumors, and are effective therapeutic targets in some human cancers. VSoccur more frequently in women and are larger, more vascular, and demonstrate increased growthrates during pregnancy. ER and PR may play a role in ErbB pathway activation and VSprogression.Study Design—Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ER and PRmessenger RNA was performed using greater auricular and vestibular nerve controls (n = 8),sporadic VS (n = 23), and NF2-related VS (n = 16) tissues.Methods—The qRT-PCR data were normalized with standardization to a single constitutivelyexpressed control gene, human cyclophylin.Results—Reverse transcription of messenger RNA from control and tumor specimens followedby RT Q-PCR demonstrated differences in ER and PR gene expression between sporadic andNF2-related VS.Conclusions—ER and PR expression in VS might have implications for development of a VS-specific drug delivery system using antihormone and ErbB pathway small molecule inhibitors, dueto crosstalk between these receptors. These signals may be critical for re-establishing ErbB-mediated cell density dependent growth inhibition.KeywordsVestibular schwannoma; neurofibromatosis 2; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; acoustic-neuroma; pregnancy; ErbB receptor family© 2008 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.Send correspondence to: Joni K.

VS, also known as acousticneuromas, are benign neurilemmomas caused by aberrant proliferation of Schwann cells inthe vestibular division of the vestibulocochlear nerve (VIIIth cranial nerve). VS commonlycause tinnitus, hearing loss, disequilibrium, facial hypesthesias, and in rare casescatastrophic brainstem compression, stroke, or death. They account for ~8% of allintracranial neoplasms and comprise ~80% of tumors in the cerebellopontine angle.2 Thereported incidence rate of VS varies worldwide from 1 to 20 cases per million inhabitantsper year in earlier studies rising to a sporadic VS incidence of 1 in 80,000 in more recentreports.3The presentation of VS is usually unilateral, sporadic, and nonfamilial, though in less than5% of cases tumors are bilateral and caused by an autosomal dominant disorder known astype 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) due to mutations in the NF2 gene that encodes the putativetumor suppressor, merlin (also called schwannomin). Most cases of VS are diagnosed inpersons in the fourth to sixth decade of life, while patients with NF2 become symptomaticroughly 20 years earlier in life. Additionally, VS can infrequently arise in association withschwannomatosis, resulting from mosaicism with respect to somatic mutations in the NF2gene that occurs during embryogenesis.4 To date, VS are presumed to arise due to amutation of NF2 and subsequent loss of heterozygosity at 22q12. Thus, functional merlinexpression is lost. The pathogenic mechanisms that follow loss of merlin expression andcontribute to the diverse patterns of VS growth are unknown.Similar to other neoplasms, it must be assumed that initiation and maintenance of VS growthis related to a dysregulation of the balance between cell proliferation and cell death, and thatproliferation of tumor cells might be promoted by mitogens that physiologically regulateSchwann cell proliferation during development or in peripheral nerve regeneration afterSchwann cell trauma.5 Schwann cells, the myelinating glial cells in the peripheral nervoussystem, synthesize progesterone in response to a diffusible neuronal signal. Progesteronethen plays a role in the formation of myelin sheaths, in addition to Schwann cells expressingan intracellular receptor for progesterone, which then functions as an autocrine signalingmolecule.6 Similarly, VS were recently shown to both produce the glial growth factorneuregulin and demonstrate activated neuregulin receptors, suggesting that VS produce andrespond to neuregulin in an autocrine fashion.7Other intriguing evidence for a hormonal influence on tumor growth emerges from studiesin which preservation of preoperative hearing after VS resection was less likely forpremenopausal women than for men or post-menopausal women.8 It has long beenspeculated that pregnancy stimulates the growth of VS. Several published reports in theliterature describe the infrequent presentation of pregnant patients with VS.9 VS arestatistically more frequent in women, and larger, more vascular tumors are twice as commonin women.10 Since nausea, vomiting, headaches and vertigo are common complaints bothduring pregnancy and in the presence of brain tumors, though intracranial lesions are rare, itis possible that they may be under-diagnosed or even missed in the pregnant patient untilneurological deficits appear. Although only 25 cases of pregnant patients with VS have beendescribed in the literature, the signs and symptoms of these tumors are generallydemonstrated to dramatically worsen during the last 3 to 4 months of pregnancy.11Prior publications have demonstrated that some VS contain estrogen receptors (ER), and ithas been theorized that estrogen may be the factor related to the acceleration of symptomsPatel et al.Page 2Laryngoscope.

Additionally, one author previously recommended termination ofpregnancy to avoid the accelerated growth phase of tumors in NF.12 Dr. Harvey Cushing in1917 was the first to report the acceleration of growth of VS during pregnancy.13 Kachharaet al.14 articulated the two leading hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying thegrowth of VS during pregnancy: one theory based on the rapid expansion or engorgement ofthe vascular bed based on the increased blood volume during pregnancy, and the secondbased on a direct hormonal effect of tumor growth mediated by the progesterone receptor(PR) and ER, which are also known to mediate the growth of meningioma cells.Investigations of the expression of estrogen and progesterone began in VS in the 1980second with significant variation in the methods employed and somewhat confusing results.Several reports in the literature have suggested a possible link between tumor behavior andexpression levels of hormone receptors.10 The first attempt to detect ER was reported in1981 by Kasantikul and detected ERs in all eight samples tested. Subsequently, eight studiesusing the radioimmunoassay method to detect radioactive bound hormone to receptors in thetumor tissue demonstrated ER present only in a minority of samples (10 –25%) of four ofthese studies.15–18 The other four studies reported no evidence of ER in theirspecimens.19 –22 Subsequently, two studies using the sucrose gradient method ofmeasurement of ER in VS tissue demonstrated four of eight specimens positive for ER, andzero of two specimens positive for ER.23 Two studies employing monoclonal antibodymethods to detect ER found no evidence of ERs in all 28 samples.21,24 A subsequent studyof messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of ER and PR detected PR mRNA in 33% of specimensbut no ER expression in any specimens.25 Allen et al.26 more recently reported a series ofeight pregnant patients with VS in 1974 and attributed increased symptoms to hormonalstimulation of tumor growth or hormonally induced intratumoral vascular dilation. In thelargest study to date, Cafer et al.27 evaluated 59 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samplesfor estrogen and PR as well as for Ki-67 proliferative marker, and found that all sampleswere positive for PR and negative for ER by immunohistochemistry. Based on informationfrom these numerous diverging studies, it was inferred that preoperative hormonal treatmentwas of unclear benefit in the treatment of VS, but interest in the possible inhibitory effect ofantiprogesterone treatment was renewed.28,29RTq-PCR has evolved as a valuable alternative to techniques such as Southern blot andfluorescence in situ hybridization for the molecular detection of alterations in gene copynumber. The technique uses complimentary DNA (cDNA) generated from mRNA, whichrepresents the expressed genes in that tissue. The advantages of this method include the lackof postPCR manipulation (thereby significantly reducing contamination risk and hands-ontime), the short time interval necessary, and the requirement for only minimal amounts ofinput cDNA, and the large dynamic range of accurate quantification. Constitutivelyexpressed reference genes are selected to normalize the data to eliminate nonspecificvariation, such as variation in cDNA input amounts between samples.No prior studies have investigated differences in expression of estrogen and PRs betweensporadic and NF2-related VS. In this study, 39 patients with sporadic VS (n =23) and NF2tumors (n =16) underwent evaluation by qPCR of expression of ER and PR compared toexpression of a constitutively active housekeeping gene, human cyclophyllin, as in internalcontrol. Expression levels of these receptor proteins were then analyzed with respect to age,gender, NF2 status, and tumor size.PATIENTS AND METHODSTo quantify endogenous expression levels of ER and PR in VS tumors, quantitative reversetranscriptase PCR (Q-PCR) was used using cDNA previously isolated from VS tissuePatel et al.Page 3Laryngoscope.

Tumors orcontrol nerve tissue obtained via this protocol are immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogenand transferred to the laboratory and stored at −70°C. The diagnosis was verified byconventional histopathologic examination of a part of the tumor. Subsequently, total RNAwas extracted from VS and control nerve samples using the Trizol reagent (GibcoInvitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA was selected byrunning total RNA over oligo-dT columns (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and mRNA (5 μg per50 μL sample) was reverse transcribed using the Gene AMP kit (Perkin-Elmer; Waltham,MA) in a DNA Engine Peltier Thermal cycler (PTC-200; MJ Research, Watertown, MA) at42°C for 1 minute, followed by 72°C for 2 hours, then held at 4°C until ready for use in Q-PCR.In each Q-PCR reaction, Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (2× buffer containingpolymerase; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used in a 15 μL reaction including 2μL of cDNA (reverse-transcribed mRNA [0.2 μg]) and 20× solution of primers andfluorophor-labeled probe (Taqman Gene Expression Assays; Applied Biosystems, FosterCity, CA) for both the transcript encoding the receptor of interest (i.e., human ER alpha orhuman PR) and an internal control (human cyclophyllin, a mitochondrial structure protein)(Table I). All expression assays were designed to span exon boundaries, to eliminate the riskof contamination from DNA or unprocessed RNA.Analysis of 39 VS specimens was completed, including 23 sporadic and 16 NF2-related VS.As controls for normal Schwann cell expression levels of ER and PR, Q-PCR analysis wasperformed using three independent sciatic nerve (SN) and four independent greater auricularnerve (GAN) specimens. Additionally, four vestibular nerve samples obtained fromMénière’s patients undergoing vestibular nerve sectioning at the University of Iowa as agenerous gift from Dr. Marlan Hansen were analyzed.An ABI Prism 7,000 Sequence Detection System was used for all reactions with thefollowing cycling parameters: 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes, then 50 cycles of(95°C for 10 second, 60°C for 1 minute) for amplification and simultaneous detection.Reactions were all performed in duplicate, and an internal control of human cyclophyllinwas amplified within the same sample well using a different fluorophor reporter fordetection (VIC; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). When the gene of interest wasundetected, the reactions were repeated with 60 cycles. Results were analyzed using aMicrosoft Excel program designed for Q-PCR quantitation based on internal control mRNAlevels, to control for differences in mRNA integrity between samples. Additionally, thisprogram calculates mRNA transcript levels as fold-induction of baseline tissue (SN andGAN, designated arbitrarily as “one-fold”) to provide comparative data.Statistical AnalysisER and PR expression levels were considered to be upregulated if they were at least 10-foldgreater than controls. Clinical information and Q-PCR data were combined and analyzedstatistically using the Fisher’s Exact test (for age, size of tumor in centimeter as measured inlargest dimension, NF2 status, and expression data), the Mann-Whitney U test (for NF2 vs.sporadic data), and the Spearman R for correlations. A two-tailed t test was used to compareQ-PCR expression data means for NF2 and sporadic VS.RESULTSA total of 12 of 23 (52%) sporadic VS samples upregulate ER, and 16 of 23 (69.6%)sporadic VS samples upregulate PR (Fig. 1A). A total of 4 of 16 (25%) NF2-related VSupregulated ER and 5 of 16 (31.3%) upregulated PR (Fig. 1B). Most NF2-related VS did notPatel et al.Page 4Laryngoscope. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 February 12.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptupregulate ER mRNA, and downregulated PR mRNA in a statistically significant manner(Fig. 2). The variability in ER mRNA expression was not statistically significant in sporadicVS versus NF2-related VS (Figs. 3A and B). Sporadic VS upregulate ER mRNA above 10-fold, and upregulate levels of PR mRNA over 100-fold.Results of Q-PCR analyses indicate that the four control GAN samples expressed higherlevels of ER and PR mRNA when compared with SN or VS (data not shown).To explore the clinical relevance of ER and PR expression, mRNA expression levels werecorrelated with clinical parameters, including patient age at presentation, tumor size, andNF2 status. The average age at presentation for NF2-related tumors was 24.5 years of age,and the mean patient age in sporadic VS was 51.6 years of age. The male to female ratio inNF2-related VS was 1:0.875, and the male to female ratio in sporadic VS was 1:2. Theaverage NF2-related VS tumor size was 2.21 cm which was similar to the average sporadicVS average tumor size of 2.17 cm.Using logistic regression with all the variables (age, gender, tumor size, ER, PR), the onlyclinical parameter that was significantly associated with NF2-related VS was younger age (P< .0148).DISCUSSIONOur results suggest that ER and PR may be potential therapeutic targets in sporadic VSbecause they were upregulated in most VS. Interestingly, PR mRNA was downregulated inNF2-related VS, which was not been reported in the literature. ER mRNA upregulationoccurred in sporadic VS, whereas PR mRNA downregulation was specific to NF2-relatedVS. Our data support the previously published suggestion that sporadic VS are twice ascommon in women than men.10It has been previously established that VS tumor cells express PR, and that conflictingreports exist regarding the expression of ER in these cells. Many of the prior studiesinvestigating ER and PR expression in VS tumors used predominantlyimmunohistochemistry. Because immunohistochemistry is nonquantitative and is notoriousfor difficulties with antigen retrieval, we felt that the question of ER and PR expression inthese tumors merited further investigation. Our results indicate that PR is downregulated inNF2-related VS, and that PR is significantly upregulated in sporadic VS. Furthermore, thelack of adequate numbers of NF2 tumors in the previous studies may explain their resultsand conclusions.The differences between NF2-related and sporadic VS are particularly interesting andsuggest possible differences in mechanisms of tumor growth. Although expression of ERand PR may play a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic VS, PR downregulation in NF2-related VS may suggest a less differentiated state. The molecular differences betweensporadic and NF2-related VS may partially explain the growth characteristics seenclinically, specifically that NF2-related VS grow at a faster rate on average and NF2-relatedVS tend to be more invasive.30 ER and PR are overexpressed or constitutively activated inseveral types of human tumors and are effective therapeutic targets in some humancancers.23,31 Tamoxifen, an orally active selective ER modulator, is used clinically in thetreatment of early and advanced ER positive breast cancer and is also Food and DrugAdministration approved for prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk ofdeveloping the disease. Selective PR modulators are defined as a new class of PR ligands,which exhibit both progesterone agonistic and antagonistic activities in vivo and are underinvestigation for the treatment of endometriosis. ER and PR independently act astranscriptional regulators. Activation of ER by ligand binding or phosphorylation is requiredPatel et al.Page 5Laryngoscope.

There is abundant evidence that ER enhances growth factor receptorsignaling independent of ligand binding. Growth factor signaling is thought to be onemechanism by which breast cancer cells become resistant to tamoxifen. Dual therapy withHerceptin (an ErbB2 inhibitor) and tamoxifen in breast cancer has decreased the occurrenceof tumor resistance. Based on the results of this study, targeting ER and PR may havetherapeutic effect in sporadic VS, but not in NF2-related VS.CONCLUSIONAs the diagnostic studies for detecting VS have become significantly more sensitive inrecent years, patients are obtaining a diagnosis with only minor symptoms. Due to highvariability in the growth rate of these tumors between patients, understanding themechanism of growth in VS tumors would be very useful for optimal management. Thehormonal status of these tumors was investigated because of the possible induction ofvascular endothelium or proliferation of Schwann cells by the estrogenic stimulation, andthe historically suggested increase in VS growth during pregnancy.The nervous system is a target for sex steroid hormones, which have significant actions onthe growth, maturation, differentiation and functioning of glial cells. The effects of thesesteroid hormones are mediated by specific high-affinity intracellular receptors, whichfunction as activated transcription factors after hormone binding. In particular, a significantincrease in myelin-specific proteins such as myelin basic protein and cyclic nucleotidephosphodiesterase was observed when oligodendrocytes, the myelinating glial cells of thecentral nervous system, were cultured in the presence of progesterone.32In this study, a relatively limited number of tumors were investigated, and a larger seriesshould be examined for further confirmation of the results. Further quantification of theresults by other confirmatory methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay shouldbe performed. If such studies support the present findings, several possible clinicalperspectives appear. Noninvasive ER and PR imaging and thereby indication of tumorgrowth would provide an equivalent perspective. Patients with fast-growing tumors maybenefit from a blockage of the ER and/or PR.Inherited cancer syndromes, like NF2, represent the ultimate mutagenesis screen for criticalgrowth regulators (tumor suppressor genes). The fact that individuals with these cancerpredisposition syndromes predictably develop specific tumors points to the unique roles ofeach of the implicated genes in growth regulation. Targeted therapies are rationally designedto interfere with specific molecular events that are important in tumor growth, progression,or survival. Clinical studies are focusing on how to best incorporate targeted therapy intocurrent treatment regimens and other studies are exploring whether different strategies forinhibiting these targets will offer greater benefit.It is clear that optimal use of targeted therapy will depend on understanding how agentsacting on ER and PR in VS tumors work mechanistically, and recognizing that theiractivities may differ across patient populations, VS tumor types, and disease stages,especially NF2. Current therapies under discussion for initiating clinical trials to treat NF2include ErbB family inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, PAK inhibitors, PI3 K/Akt inhibitors, FAKinhibitors, Raf inhibitors, MTOR inhibitors, and angiogenesis inhibitors. Since crosstalkoccurs between ER and ErbB2 signaling pathways, dual therapy, targeting these tworeceptor types, might prove more effective in the long term.We are currently investigating the role of ER and PR in VS growth in an in vitro model.Further studies are necessary to determine whether hormone receptors play a significant rolein VS tumorigenesis or progression.Patel et al.Page 6Laryngoscope.
