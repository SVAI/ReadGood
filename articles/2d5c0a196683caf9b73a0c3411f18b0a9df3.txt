834 www.thelancet.com/neurology   Vol 13   August 2014ReviewNeuroﬁ bromatosis type 1: a multidisciplinary approach to careAngela C Hirbe, David H GutmannNeuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 is a relatively common inherited disorder. Patients have a high predisposition to develop both benign and malignant tumours. Although many manifestations of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 aﬀ ect the nervous system, other organs and tissues can also be aﬀ ected. Because of the varying features and clinical heterogeneity inherent to this disorder, patients can present to diﬀ erent medical and surgical specialists and, therefore, the association of clinical symptoms with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 might not be appreciated. Thus, for prompt diagnosis and to provide optimum care for patients with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1, clinicians must be aware of the diverse clinical features of this disorder. We advocate a multidisciplinary approach to care, entailing a dedicated team of specialists throughout the lifetime of the patient. As our understanding of this disorder deepens through basic laboratory and clinical investigations, swift implementation of new eﬀ ective treatments becomes feasible.IntroductionNeuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 is a relatively common inherited disorder that aﬀ ects about one in 2500 to one in 3000 people world wide, irrespective of sex or ethnic origin.1,2 Individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 are prone to develop benign and malignant tumours of the CNS and peripheral nervous system, in addition to malignant diseases aﬀ ecting other parts of the body.3 Tumours that are commonly associated with the disorder include glioma of the optic pathway, glioblastoma, malig nant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, gastrointestinal stromal tumour, breast cancer, leukaemia, phaeo chromo cytoma, duodenal carcinoid tumour, and rhabdo myo sarcoma (table).4–13Neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 was ﬁ rst described by Frederich von Recklinghausen in 1882. In 1987, formal diagnostic criteria were published by the National Institutes of Health (panel).14 In this Review, we describe benign and malig-nant features of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1, focusing on diagnostic strategies, monitoring, and treatment of tumours located in the nervous system and elsewhere. Additionally, we highlight possible future therapeutic directions based on ﬁ ndings of preclinical drug discovery and evaluation studies in genetically engineered mouse models of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated malignant diseases. Finally, we discuss current and future clinical trials in patients with neuro ﬁ bromatosis type 1.Genetics and genetic testingNeuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 is a dominantly inherited genetic disorder that results from a germline mutation in the NF1 tumour-suppressor gene. NF1 is located on chromosome 17q11.2 and encodes a 220 kDa cytoplasmic protein called neuroﬁ bromin. This protein functions, in part, as a negative regulator of the Ras proto-oncogene, which is a key signalling molecule in the control of cell growth.15 Aﬀ ected individuals start life with one mutated (non-functional) copy and one functional copy of NF1 in every cell in their body. Although many of the clinical features of this syndrome are apparent from birth, complete loss of gene function is needed for formation of tumours, by acquisition of a somatic NF1 mutation in selected cells.16,17About 50% of individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 have no family history of the disease and the disease is due to de novo (spontaneous) mutations. With the advent of accurate genetic testing, early genotype-phenotype correlations are beginning to emerge, including the observation that people with genomic microdeletions aﬀ ecting the entire NF1 gene have a more severe phenotype.18,19 For instance, this particular subgroup of Lancet Neurol 2014; 13: 834–43Departments of Medicine (A C Hirbe MD) and Neurology (D H Gutmann MD), Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USACorrespondence to:Dr David H Gutmann, Department of Neurology, St Louis, MO 63110, USAgutmannd@neuro.wustl.eduLifetime riskGlioma of the optic pathway15–20%Other brain tumourMore than ﬁ vefold increaseMalignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumour8–13%Gastrointestinal stromal tumour4–25%Breast cancerAbout ﬁ vefold increaseLeukaemiaAbout sevenfold increasePhaeochromocytoma0·1–5·7%Duodenal carcinoid tumour1%Rhabdomyosarcoma1·4–6%Table: Lifetime risk of diﬀ erent tumours in children and adults with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1Panel: NIH consensus criteria14 for diagnosis of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1Two or more of the following clinical features are suﬃ  cient to establish a diagnosis of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1:• Six or more café-au-lait macules (>0·5 cm at largest diameter in a prepubertal child or >1·5 cm in post-pubertal individuals)• Axillary freckling or freckling in inguinal regions• Two or more neuroﬁ bromas of any type or one or more plexiform neuroﬁ bromas• Two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas)• A distinctive osseous lesion (sphenoid wing dysplasia, long-bone dysplasia)• An optic pathway glioma• A ﬁ rst-degree relative with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 diagnosed by the above criteriaNIH=National Institutes of Health.www.thelancet.com/neurology   Vol 13   August 2014 835Reviewindividuals with NF1 microdeletions tend to develop neuroﬁ bromas at an earlier age, have a lower mean IQ, manifest abnormal facial features, and are at increased risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumours.19–21 At present, the diagnosis of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 is most commonly made using established clinical criteria,14 reserving NF1 genetic testing for unusual presentations or reproductive decision-making.Non-malignant clinical featuresPigmentary abnormalities  Frequently, the earliest clinical manifestation of neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1 is café-au-lait macules, which usually develop within the ﬁ rst 2 years of life (ﬁ gure 1). The presence of more than ﬁ ve café-au-lait macules (>0·5 cm in diameter before puberty or >1·5 cm after puberty) is one of the diagnostic criteria for neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1. These lesions have no malignant potential and tend to darken with sun exposure and fade with advancing age. For macules that reduce quality of life, individuals can be oﬀ ered dermatological camouﬂ age treatments.22Axillary and inguinal freckling is another common clinical feature of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 and is usually detected in aﬀ ected individuals by age 5–8 years. These pigmentary abnormalities are typically the second diagnostic characteristic seen in children with the disorder, generally arising after development of café-au-lait macules. Freckles can also be found in areas where skinfolds are in apposition, including the neck and under the breasts in women.23Lisch nodules are benign melanocytic hamartomas of the iris, typically ﬁ rst noticed in children aged 5–10 years. Nearly all adults with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 have Lisch nodules. These pigmented lesions are best detected on slit-lamp examination by an experienced ophthal-mologist.23 Lisch nodules do not impair vision or cause any medical problems.Neuroﬁ bromas  Neuroﬁ bromas are benign Schwann-cell tumours composed not only of neoplastic Schwann cells24,25 but also of non-neoplastic ﬁ broblasts, mast cells, macro-phages, endothelial cells, pericytes, and perineural cells.26–29 There are four subtypes: cutaneous, sub-cutaneous, nodular or diﬀ use plexiform, and spinal.Intracutaneous neuroﬁ bromas develop during late childhood or early adolescence and do not undergo malignant transformation. Owing to an abundance of mast cells associated with the tumours, these tumours might cause local pruritus. Intracutaneous neuro ﬁ bromas can result in substantial discomfort or disﬁ gure ment when hundreds or thousands of these neuroﬁ bromas are present in a patient. In such instances, the tumours can be removed by a plastic surgeon.22 Spinal neuroﬁ bromas can occur at single or multiple nerve roots and are associated with both sensory and motor deﬁ cits.Although neuroﬁ bromas are commonly found on the skin—presenting as subcutaneous, dermal, or exophytic masses—they can also be located deep within the body. Individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 generally develop more neuroﬁ bromas as they get older, and some patients can have many deep neuroﬁ bromas without clinical symptoms. In these patients, tumour removal should be led by symptoms—such as pain and functional deﬁ cits—and ﬁ ndings of a risk-beneﬁ t assessment.Plexiform neuroﬁ bromas  Plexiform neuroﬁ bromas typically manifest at birth but can continue to grow during adolescence and early adulthood (ﬁ gure 2). In most individuals, these tumours enlarge most prominently during the ﬁ rst decade of life. Plexiform neuroﬁ bromas develop in about 30–50% of individuals Figure 1: Café-au-lait maculeMacule on a 24-year-old woman with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 who was diagnosed as a young child (measuring tape shown for reference).

They diﬀ er from cutaneous neuroﬁ bromas in that they arise from multiple nerve fascicles and can grow along the length of a nerve.30 These tumours can also extend into surroun ding structures, causing substantial pain and bone destruction. Importantly, plexiform neuroﬁ bromas have a lifetime risk of malignant transformation. Although the best therapeutic option for symptomatic lesions is surgical removal, this approach is sometimes technically impossible.3Chemotherapy is a potential therapeutic option for plexiform neuroﬁ bromas. In a recent phase 1 trial, pegylated interferon-alfa-2b (antiviral cytokine therapy)was assessed in 30 patients with plexiform neuroﬁ bromas who had radiographic progression before enrolment.31 Reported eﬀ ects were pain reduction (in 11 of 16 patients), decreased tumour mass (13 of 14), and tumour shrinkage or stabilisation (three of four). Similarly, in a phase 2 trial of imatinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), 17% of patients with plexiform neuroﬁ bromas had a 20% or more reduction in tumour volume.32 In view of these initial encouraging results, several studies are now in progress to test the use of other biologically targeted therapies, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors in these patients.Skeletal deformities  People with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 can develop skeletal abnormalities, including osteopenia, scoliosis, sphenoid wing dysplasia, congenital tibial dysplasia, and pseudarthrosis (ﬁ gure 3). Moreover, aﬀ ected individuals tend to be shorter than expected for their age and frequently have low bone-mineral densities.33 In a large registry-based study of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1, a roughly ﬁ vefold increase in fracture risk was reported for adults older than 40 years, and this risk was about threefold higher in children younger than 16 years.34 Lifestyle modiﬁ cations such as increased exercise and calcium or vitamin D supplementation might be warranted in these patients. Low concentrations of vitamin D have been recorded in people with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1.33,35–38 In a retro spective study of vitamin D supplementation, loss of bone-mineral density was reduced signiﬁ cantly in adult patients with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 whose vitamin D levels were maintained above 30 μg/L, compared with people who had not been supplemented.39 Although this ﬁ nding suggests that all adults should be screened for vitamin D deﬁ ciency and appropriate replacements initiated, prospective studies are needed before practice recom-mendations are changed.Scoliosis can aﬀ ect 10–26% of individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1, making annual spinal examinations necessary during childhood and early adolescence.40 Mild curvature can be treated with bracing; however, more severe cases might need surgery to stabilise progressive spinal and chest-wall deformity and preserve lung function by minimising constrictive forces.3 The vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR), which is used to diminish constrictive forces on the lung, has shown promise in clinical trials.41 It is noteworthy that some individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 have dystrophic scoliosis with striking curvatures and generally less satisfactory surgical outcomes than those without striking curvatures.Sphenoid wing dysplasia typically presents as a unilateral bony defect aﬀ ecting the orbital plate and the frontal bone. Sometimes, thinning or absence of the sphenoid wing is attributable to the presence of an associated orbital plexiform neuroﬁ broma, but it can occur as an isolated bony abnormality.42 These defects are usually seen in Figure 3: Skeletal abnormalities in individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1Plain ﬁ lm radiographs showing: (A) dystrophic scoliosis (asterisk) in an 11-year-old girl; (B) tibial bowing (asterisk) in a 10-month-old baby girl; (C) tibial pseudarthrosis (asterisk) in a 9-month-old baby girl; and (D) tibial pseudarthrosis after insertion of an internal rod (asterisk) in a 9-year-old boy. BADC****www.thelancet.com/neurology   Vol 13   August 2014 837Reviewasymptomatic individuals after a careful physical examination in which one eye appears asymmetric or is proptotic or sunken. Congenital tibial dysplasia generally presents as anterolateral bowing of the lower leg, with cortical thinning evident on plain radiographs. The presence of bowing in an infant should warrant prompt radiographic assessment. Repeated fractures with failure to heal can lead to development of pseudarthrosis and, in some cases, limb amputation.43 Referral to a skilled paediatric orthopaedic surgeon is needed to initiate appropriate treatment and avoid this poor outcome.Cardiovascular abnormalities  Individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 can develop various cardiovascular abnormalities, ranging from con-genital heart disease to vasculopathy and hyper tension. Echocardiographic data suggest that up to 27% of patients with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 have a cardio vascular anomaly,44 and pulmonary artery stenosis accounts for as many as 50% of these abnormalities.45 The prevalence of abnormalities is likely to be an under estimate because a diagnosis is usually made only if symptoms develop. Therefore, all children born with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 should have a thorough cardiac examination and any murmurs should be investigated further by a skilled paediatric cardiologist.46Neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-related vasculopathy includes renal and cerebral artery stenosis, aortic coarctation, and arteriovenous malformations.47 The pathogenesis, clinical spectrum, and natural history of these anomalies remains poorly understood; however, impaired NF1 gene function in vascular endothelial cells results in increased proliferation and growth.27,48,49 Vasculopathy usually aﬀ ects the arterial system, leading to cerebrovascular disease (eg, narrowed or ectatic vessels, vascular stenosis, aneurysm, or moyamoya disease) or renal artery stenosis.47,50,51 Individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 who present with a new neurological deﬁ cit should be assessed for both cerebrovascular disease and brain tumour. Moreover, any patient with unexplained hyper-tension should undergo investigation for renal artery stenosis. Laboratory assessments (serum creatinine and electrolytes, plasma renin, and urinalysis), approp riate imaging studies, and arteriography are important. Although essential hypertension remains the most common reason for raised blood pressure in this population, other causes include coarctation of the aorta and phaeochromocytoma. Some of these abnormalities are likely to be congenital; however, whether vascular stenoses are actually present at birth is unclear. Further study is needed to resolve these uncertainties.Neurocognitive deﬁ cits  Neurocognitive deﬁ cits are among the most common manifestations of neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1. Children should undergo neuropsychological screening assess-ments early in life, followed by more detailed testing when appropriate.52 Learning diﬃ  culties can include visuospatial and visuomotor deﬁ cits, language disorders, and ﬁ ne and gross motor deﬁ ciencies. Furthermore, attention-deﬁ cit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, behavioural abnormalities, and psychosocial issues are prevalent in this population.53 Children with neuro ﬁ bro matosis type 1 might beneﬁ t from a multi disciplinary approach, in which educational specialists, paediatric neuro -psychologists, physical thera pists, speech therapists, and occupational therapists work together to maximise abilities and optimise the chance for academic and social success. Pharmacological inter ven tions with treatments such as lovastatin54 or drugs used to treat attention-deﬁ cit hyperactivity disorder (eg, methyl-phenidate) might be of beneﬁ t for some children.Nervous-system tumoursOptic pathway and brainstem gliomas  About 15–20% of individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 will develop low-grade glial neoplasms; roughly 80% are in the optic pathway, but some (15%) can be present in the brainstem,22 with rare involvement of the cerebellum, cortex, and subcortical regions.5 Optic pathway gliomas (ﬁ gure 4A) typically present in children with neuro ﬁ bromatosis type 1 who are younger than 7 years.55 These tumours are mainly WHO grade I glial neoplasms—termed pilocytic astrocytomas—and are indistinguishable histologically from gliomas that arise sporadically in individuals without neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1.56 Although many optic pathway gliomas are asymptomatic, up to half can cause clinical symptoms, most commonly resulting in reduced vision; some children present with precocious puberty.57Owing to the frequency of optic pathway gliomas in young children with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1, all patients who are younger than 13 years should undergo an Figure 4: Low-grade glial neoplasms(A) MRI showing an optic glioma in the left optic nerve (asterisk) of a 4-year-old boy with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1. (B) MRI showing a brainstem glioma (asterisk) in a 9-year-old boy with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1.BA**838 www.thelancet.com/neurology   Vol 13   August 2014Reviewophthal mological examination every year by a paediatric neuro-ophthalmologist. Screening MRI is not recom-mended unless children are unable to undertake the ophthalmological assessment and reliable measure ments of visual acuity cannot be obtained.55 On identiﬁ cation of an optic glioma, current recommendations include ophthalmological and MRI studies four times a year for the ﬁ rst year, followed by gradual lengthening of test intervals over the next 2–3 years. A two-line decrease in visual acuity, as measured by a standardised visual assessment procedure such as the Snellen chart, warrants referral to a paediatric neuro-oncologist for treatment.58Surgery plays little part in the treatment of optic pathway gliomas because it can result in permanent neurological damage.58 First-line treatment for most patients with symptomatic tumours is chemotherapy with carboplatin and vincristine.59 Other chemotherapy combinations have been used; however, no randomised trial data are available to support the use of one regimen over another.60 Cranial radiation therapy is not recom-mended for patients with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 because of the increased propensity of this population to develop second malignancies, vascular abnormalities, and neuropsychological diﬃ  culties.10,61Brainstem gliomas are the most frequently discovered brain tumor outside of the optic pathway in people with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1.22 Similar to optic pathway tumours, brainstem gliomas (ﬁ gure 4B) are usually pilocytic astrocytomas; however, they typically present later in the ﬁ rst decade of life. Aﬀ ected children might come to medical attention with cranial neuropathies, lethargy, gait instability, or headaches. Chemotherapy is used to treat clinically progressive tumours, with drugs such as carboplatin or vincristine, as would be administered for other low-grade gliomas in the paediatric population.Glioblastomas  Individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 have at least a ﬁ vefold increased risk for developing other brain tumours, including WHO grade IV astrocytomas (glio-blastomas), according to ﬁ ndings of several case reports and small retrospective studies.9,62–64 Glioblastomas usually present in young adults,65 in whom the overall prognosis is poor. Treatment is similar to that for people with sporadic glioblastomas and usually entails gross surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy (typically oral temozolomide).Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours—sometimes referred to as neuroﬁ brosarcomas or neurogenic sarcomas—are a subtype of sarcoma with a presumed Schwann cell origin. These tumours represent about 3–10% of all soft-tissue sarcomas, and a large proportion arise in individuals with neuro ﬁ bromatosis type 1.66 Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours have a prevalence of 0·001% in the general population versus 0·1% in individuals with neuro ﬁ bromatosis type 1.6,67 The cumulative lifetime risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours in a patient with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 is about 8–13%.68 Malig-nant peripheral nerve sheath tumours can arise any-where within the body. Risk for developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour is increased 20-fold in the area of an existing internal plexiform neuroﬁ broma.69 Other risk factors for development of malignant peri-pheral nerve sheath tumours include previous radia tion therapy and large germline mutations encompassing the entire NF1 gene (microdeletions).21Individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 who report substantial or diﬃ  cult-to-control pain, a rapid increase in the size of an existing plexiform neuroﬁ broma, a change in tumour consistency (soft to hard), or a new neurological deﬁ cit warrant prompt assessment for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours.67 MRI is helpful to deﬁ ne the location and extent of the tumour, but it is not reliable for distinguishing between malignant disease and benign tumours. Over the past decade, ¹⁸F-ﬂ uoro-deoxy glucose (¹⁸F-FDG)-PET has emerged as a highly sensitive and speciﬁ c method for detection of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (ﬁ gure 5).70–72 Needle biopsy can be aﬀ ected by sampling bias and might not allow the treating clinician to exclude a diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour with conﬁ dence.67 Furthermore, patients with suspected malignant disease should be examined for evidence of metastatic disease (eg, in the lung or bone). In view of the aggressive nature of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, patients should be assessed and managed by a multidisciplinary team including neurologists, radiologists, surgeons, oncologists, and radiation oncolo gists to eﬃ  ciently implement plans for biopsy (non-invasive or open) and treatment.Surgery is the only curative treatment option for patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours.73 Even with surgical excision, 5-year overall survival rates are poor,6,74 and this cancer represents a substantial cause of mortality in individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1.9 Some ﬁ ndings suggest that survival is beginning to increase, particularly in women; however, this rise might be attributable to heightened recognition and identiﬁ cation of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours at an earlier stage.75 Although radiation therapy could delay time to recurrence, this treatment does not change time to death.67,76 Use of adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial.77,78 In some instances, chemotherapy can be used in the neoadjuvant setting to downstage tumours before resection; however, this practice has not been adopted widely.67 Clinical studies of promising chemotherapy drugs are underway in individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours. In patients with metastatic disease, single-agent anthracycline is the most accepted form of palliative care.67,79www.thelancet.com/neurology   Vol 13   August 2014 839ReviewNon-nervous-system tumoursGastrointestinal stromal tumours  Gastrointestinal stromal tumours are of mesenchymal origin and can develop anywhere along the gastro-intestinal tract. Compared with the general population, individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 are slightly younger at presentation (median age 50 years vs 60 years)80,81 and about 95% are asymptomatic. Moreover, patients with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 and gastro-intestinal stromal tumours more frequently present with multiple tumours compared with the general popu lation.82 The most common symptoms reported are abdominal pain, bleeding, intestinal perforation, and intestinal obstruction.66,83 Gastrointestinal stro mal tumours can be an incidental ﬁ nding during imaging studies, might be spotted during surgery to remove another tumour, or could be diagnosed from presenting symptoms.In the general population, gastrointestinal stromal tumours are associated with increased expression of the KIT and PDGFRA transmembrane receptors. Activation of these receptor tyrosine kinases drives proliferation, providing the scientiﬁ c basis for treatment with imatinib.80,84 By contrast, in patients with neuro ﬁ bro-matosis type 1, gastrointestinal stromal tumours typically do not overexpress KIT or PDGFRA,85 which limits the use of imatinib in this population.86,87 Currently, the only treatment option for neuro ﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated gastro intestinal stromal tumours is surgery, if feasible. Clinical trials of other tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors (eg, sunitinib) are ongoing in patients with metastatic disease.88Breast cancers  A ﬁ vefold increased risk for breast cancer has been reported in individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1, mainly aﬀ ecting women younger than 50 years.8,13,89,90 Furthermore, mortality rates in women with neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1 and breast cancer are higher than those for women with breast cancer in the general population.91 Although reported studies include only a few patients, relative risks are similar to those for people with a family history of breast cancer. Women age 30–49 years with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 could undergo early mammography or MRI;92 however, large prospective studies are needed before formal recom-mendations can be made about screening in this population. Currently, treatment for neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated breast cancer does not diﬀ er from that for women with breast cancer in the general population.Leukaemia and lymphoma  Children with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 have at least a sevenfold higher risk for developing myeloid leukaemia compared with children in the general population,93 and the prevalence of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, juvenile chronic myelogenous leukaemia, acute lympho-cytic leukaemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma is also raised.94,95 However, these tumours are rare in people with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1. Moreover, no evidence is available to support a diﬀ erence in prognosis between neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated leukaemia and lymphoma relative to the general population. Treatments for neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated leukaemia parallel those used for individuals without neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1.95Phaeochromocytoma  Phaeochromocytomas—catecholamine-secreting tumours of the adrenal medulla or other sites in the sympathetic nervous system—are seen at increased frequency in individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1. These tumours arise in 0·1–5·7% of people with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 compared with 0·002–0·008% of the general population. The age of onset (typically the fourth decade of life) is similar in neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated and sporadic cases.12,96 Phaeochromocytomas should be sus-pected in an individual with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 who presents with unexplained hypertension, ﬂ ushing, Figure 5: Malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumours¹⁸F-FDG-PET images showing malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumours (asterisks) in (A) a 24-year-old woman and (B) a 29-year-old man, both with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1.

Diagnosis is established typically with a combination of imaging studies (CT or MRI of the chest and abdomen or a meta-iodobenzyl -guanidine scan or somatostatin scinti-graphy if CT is negative) and biochemical assessments (eg, the amount of catecholamines in urine).97 Surgery is curative for resectable disease,98 whereas chemotherapy or radio pharmaceutical treatment with ¹³¹I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine is used for metastatic or unresectable cancers.99,100Duodenal carcinoids  Carcinoid tumours are neuroendocrine tumours that arise from endocrine cells within the gastrointestinal tract; they are reported in about 1% of individuals with neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1.7,101 The most common site for carcinoid tumours is the periampullary region;4,66 therefore, indivi-duals usually present with jaundice and non-speciﬁ c abdominal pain. In patients with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1, these tumours generally present at a young age.101,102 The diagnosis of carcinoid tumours is typically made with a combination of imaging studies—eg, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, somatostatin scintigraphy, and endoscopic ultrasound or endoscopy—and measure ment of urinary and serum 5-hydroxyindolectic acid and chroma-granin A, when clinically appropriate.101 Surgical resection should be done if possible; unresectable and metastatic disease is treated generally with somatostatin analogues or chemotherapy.101,103Rhabdomyosarcomas  Rhabdomyosarcomas are non-neurogenic sarcomas composed of small round blue cells that probably originate from the neural crest.66 Children with neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1 have about a 20-fold increased risk of developing these tumours.11 Rhabdomyosarcomas most commonly present as palpable masses. Manage ment relies on surgical resection when feasible, whereas adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy might be appropriate for some individuals.104,105Conclusions and future directionsOver the past 15 years, substantial advances have been made in our ability to discover, validate, and translate laboratory-based research ﬁ ndings to the clinical work-place. Many accurate preclinical models of neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated malignant disease in genetically engineered mice have been developed and used as platforms to evaluate rational targeted treatments. 106–114 Although these models have some limitations, they have already proven useful in the design and implementation of human clinical trials. After identiﬁ cation of NF1 as a negative Ras regulator,115–117 ﬁ ndings of several preclinical studies in Nf1-deﬁ cient mice have shown that inhibition of down stream targets of Ras attenuates Nf1-deﬁ cient tumour cell growth in vitro and in vivo. For example, in studies of genetically engineered Nf1 mice, rapamycin analogues (eg, everolimus) and MEK inhibitors were eﬀ ec tive biologi cally targeted treatments for neuroﬁ bro ma tosis type 1-associated plexiform neuro ﬁ broma,118,119 and rapamycin analogues and chemokine recep tor inhibitors were assessed for neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated glioma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours.120–123Models of optic pathway glioma109,124 and plexiform neuroﬁ broma108 in genetically engineered Nf1 mice showed that non-cancerous stromal cells (tumour microenvironment) have important roles in tumour development and growth. Loss of Nf1 in Schwann cell and astroglial cell precursors alone was not suﬃ  cient for tumorigenesis; loss of Nf1 expression in Schwann cell or astroglial cell precursors must occur in Nf1+/− mice (genetically comparable with individuals with neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1) for neuroﬁ bromas and optic gliomas, respectively, to form.108,109,124 Further investigation of participatory stromal cell types in models of optic pathway gliomas and plexiform neuroﬁ bromas in genetically engineered Nf1  mice indicates an obligatory role for microglia and mast cells, respectively, in the genesis and maintenance of these tumours.125–127 The ﬁ nding that mast cells are important micro-environmental drivers of plexiform neuroﬁ broma growth culminated in use of imatinib to inhibit c-kit function in preclinical studies in Nf1 mice and the translation of these results to human clinical trials.32Although studies of these genetically engineered Nf1 mice hold substantial promise, future studies need to report clearly positive ﬁ ndings to facilitate eﬀ ective translation to human clinical trials. Thus, preclinical response criteria should incorporate the proportion of mice with signiﬁ cant radiographic responses, the durability of these outcomes, and the extent of tumour shrinkage. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations will also need to be integrated into these criteria to ensure a high likelihood of success in patients.With the establishment of the Neuroﬁ bromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium (NFCTC),128 therapeutic trials in large numbers of individuals with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated malignant disease can now be under-taken eﬃ  ciently. Up to now, the NFCTC has initiated several clinical trials, including studies of sorafenib for neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neuro-ﬁ bromas (NCT00727233), bevacizumab and everolimus for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (NCT01661283), everolimus for progressive neuro-ﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated glioma (NCT01158651), Search strategy and selection criteriaWe searched PubMed between January, 1970, and March, 2014, with the terms: “NF1”, “skin”, “bone”, “cardiovascular”, “neurocognitive”, “plexiform”, “malignancy”, “optic pathway glioma”, “GBM”, “MPNST”, “breast cancer”, “leukemia”, “GIST”, “pheochromocytoma”, “duodenal carcinoids”, and “rhabdomyosarcoma”.

With availability of accurate preclinical mouse models for most tumour types in neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1, a detailed understanding of neuroﬁ bromin-controlled signalling pathways, and avail-ability of a clinical trials infrastructure for rapid drug evaluation, we can now envision a future in which eﬀ ective treatments for people with neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1-associated tumours are imminent.ContributorsACH wrote the manuscript and prepared the ﬁ gures.
