1535www.eymj.orgINTRODUCTIONThe treatment options for small to medium sized vestibular schwannomas include observation, radiotherapy, and sur-gery.1 Recent refinement of surgical techniques has made it possible to prioritize hearing preservation after tumor resec-tion.2 Moreover, hearing after tumor removal can be restored in patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas or those with a schwannoma in the only-hearing ear.3 The standard treatment for unilateral hearing loss after uni-lateral vestibular schwannoma resection has been bone con-ducting or bone anchoring hearing aids (BCHA or BAHA), though cochlear implantation (CI) has emerged as an alterna-tive method of acoustic rehabilitation, provided that the co-chlear nerve remains intact.4 Studies of electrical promontory stimulation in patients after vestibular schwannoma resection have demonstrated favorable results.5,6 Since the indications for CI have recently expanded, CI has been suggested by many as an appropriate adjunctive treat-ment to vestibular schwannoma resection.7-9 Patients with bi-lateral vestibular schwannomas or with a schwannoma in the only-hearing ear are candidates for CI. In addition, patients with good hearing in the contralateral side are also candidates for the quality of life. Early cochlear degeneration can limit hearing rehabilitation via CI, particularly if there is significant delay after schwannoma resection, despite of sparing the co-chlear nerve.4We describe herein two cases of hearing rehabilitation via CI implemented at the time of vestibular schwannoma resection.CASE REPORTCase 1A 72-year-old woman presented with moderate to severe bi-lateral hearing impairment. She had used conventional hear-ing aids in the left ear for eight years, but presented for evalua-tion of deteriorating hearing secondary to worsening otorrhea.

Moreover, restoration of hearing after tumor removal can be attempted in patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas or those with a schwannoma in the only-hearing ear. Cochlear implantation (CI) has emerged as a proper method of acoustic rehabilitation, provided that the cochlear nerve remains intact. Studies of electrical promontory stimulation in patients after vestibular schwannoma resection have demonstrated favorable results. We describe herein two cases of hearing rehabilitation via CI implemented at the time of vestibu-lar schwannoma resection. Tumors were totally removed, and cochlear implant electrodes were successfully inserted in both cases. Also, post operative CI-aided hearing showed improved results.Key Words:  Vestibular schwannoma, cochlear implantation, translabyrinthine approachCase ReportpISSN: 0513-5796 · eISSN: 1976-2437Received: July 1, 2015   Revised: October 13, 2015Accepted: October 13, 2015Corresponding author: Dr. In Seok Moon, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Korea.Tel: 82-2-2228-3606, Fax: 82-2-393-0580, E-mail: ismoonmd@yuhs.ac•The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.© Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2016This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-mons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and repro-duction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Yonsei Med J 2016 Nov;57(6):1535-1539http://dx.doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2016.57.6.15351536Simultaneous CI in VS’shttp://dx.doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2016.57.6.1535Fig. 1.

A pure tone audiogram revealed right sensorineural and left mixed hearing loss (Fig. 1A). Speech discrimination scores were 72% in the right ear at the most comfortable listening (MCL) level, and immeasur-able in the left ear. Temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was thus obtained, revealing an 8 mm intracanalicular schwannoma on the left (Fig. 1C and D). Due to the patient’s age and small tumor size, our initial management was conservative, consisting of observation and infection control. However, as the patient desired improvement of hearing in her left ear, we opted for tumor resection with si-multaneous CI. Six months pre-operatively, we performed a tympanomastoidectomy on the left ear, which resulted in con-trolled infection and a well-tympanized eardrum. The bone conduction of the left ear was reserved, and the air-bone gap of left ear was reduced. Subsequently, we resected the tumor via a translabyrinthine approach with concurrent CI (SONATATI100, MedEL, Innsbruck, Austria) via facial recess approach (Fig. 1E and F). We were able to preserve the cochlear nerve, as well as achieve total tumor resection.Two years post-operatively, pure tone audiometry demon-strated a threshold of 38.8 dB in the CI augmented left ear and 30.0 dB in the hearing aid augmented right ear (Fig. 1B).

A 1 dB decrease in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) corresponds to a 9% improvement in binau-ral hearing.10,11 On average, patients who received CI showed a 19.8% improvement in binaural hearing under front noise; in bimodal mode, a 36% improvement was shown under front noise, and 27% improvement under composite noise. Case 2A 58-year-old man who had undergone canal wall down tym-panomastoidectomy in his right ear presented with bilateral hearing impairment. He complained of chronic hearing loss in the right ear, as well as abrupt hearing loss in the left. A pure tone audiogram revealed bilateral mixed hearing loss with an average air conduction threshold of 43 dB in the right ear and 72 dB in the left (Fig. 2A). Speech discrimination scores were 92% in the right ear at 86 dB MCL and 88% in the left ear at 102 dB MCL. A year later, a follow-up pure tone audiogram showed complete hearing loss (scale out) in the left ear, along with an unmeasurable speech discrimination score. A left internal au-ditory canal intracanalicular mass lesion was noted on the pre-operative brain MRI scan, with diameter of 6 mm and width of 13 mm (Fig. 2C and D).We proposed two surgical approaches: mass excision via translabyrinthine approach, followed by either BAHA or CI. This patient and his family opted for the latter option. We con-ducted canal wall down mastoidectomy, subtotal petrosecto-my and EAC closure for infection control, and the tumor was totally resected via translabyrinthine approach, with success-ful electrode insertion via round window approach (CONCER-TO08363, MedEL, Austria) (Fig. 2E-H). At three month follow-up, CI-aided pure tone audiogram revealed an average sound field threshold of 48.8 dB in the left ear (Fig. 2B). Notably, his tinnitus was also markedly reduced.DISCUSSIONIn considering surgical resection of small or medium sized vestibular schwannomas, priority should be given to the pres-ervation or restoration of hearing. BCHA or BAHA have been standard treatments for post-surgical unilateral hearing impair-ment, but are limited in their capacity to improve hearing in the affected ear. Reports from several centers on CI and laby-rinthectomy or vestibular schwannoma resection show a favor-able prognosis for concurrent or post-operative CI.7,9,12-14 In fact, the prognosis was similar to that of unilaterally deaf pa-tients treated with CI. Fig. 2. (E) The tumor (T) was separated and dissected from CN VIII (white arrow). (F) After tumor removal via a translabyrinthine approach, a well-pre-served cochleo-vestibular nerve (arrow) and intact facial nerve (white arrowhead) were noted. (G) After repair of the dura with abdominal fat, the round window of the cochlea (arrowhead) was identified. (H) Cochlear implantation was performed simultaneously. The internal device electrode (arrow) was inserted through the round window.GHCOLOREF1539Jin Won Kim, et al.http://dx.doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2016.57.6.1535Candidacy criteria for CI with tumor resection include total tumor removal, preservation of the cochlear nerve anatomy and function, and surgeon experience. Anatomical preserva-tion of cochlear nerve cannot assure its functional preservation, therefore, intraoperative monitoring can be useful. However, in the present case, we couldn’t monitor for several reasons.MRI can be used post-operatively to evaluate remnant tu-mor tissue prior to CI implementation, if performed years af-ter resection. In such cases, however, cochlear ossification and cochlear nerve atrophy can present complications. In our cases, complete tumor resection was not necessary for MRI evalua-tion, therefore, an enhanced CT was used instead for follow-up. Arriaga and Marks10 were the first to report on concurrent CI and schwannoma resection with favorable outcomes. Suc-cessful hearing restoration with CI depends on survival of the spiral ganglion nerve fibers, as well as the patency of the co-chlea. The rapid and significant improvement in speech recog-nition with CI suggests that, despite the presence of tumor in the cochlear nerve and potential intra-operative injuries, the number of surviving spiral ganglion axons is sufficient for CI rehabilitation. There are thus far no reports comparing out-comes between concurrent and staged procedures. Neverthe-less, since calcification of inner ear structures can occur as a post-operative complication, earlier implementation of CI op-eration should be sought for hearing restoration and improve-ment of quality of life.REFERENCES1.
