Most tumor suppressors function intracellularly to control the cell division cycle; however, the interface between a cell and its environment also plays a critical role in tumor development and metastasis. The product of the neurofi bromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene, Merlin, localizes to and appears to act at this interface (McClatchey and Giovannini, 2005). Loss of NF2 function is associated with the development of multiple cancers in humans and mice (McClatchey et al., 1998; Giovannini et al., 2000; Baser et al., 2002). In humans, NF2 mutations are associated with familial and sporadic nervous system tumors and with other sporadic cancers such as mesothelioma, whereas heterozygous Nf2 mutant mice develop bone, liver, and other tumors that are highly meta-static. Treatment strategies for NF2 are currently limited given the often intractable location and multiplicity of tumors, to-gether with their tendency to recur. Surgical approaches are the current standard therapy and pharmacological treatments are not available.Merlin is closely related to the ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins that are thought to organize cortical membrane domains that interface with the extracellular environment, via linking membrane-associated proteins to the actin cytoskeleton (Bretscher et al., 2002; Lallemand et al., 2003; McClatchey, 2003; Ramesh, 2004). Although Merlin can functionally and physically interact with several proteins, including p21-activated kinase (Kissil et al., 2003; Hirokawa et al., 2004), CD44 (Morrison et al., 2001) and the two PDZ domain –containing adaptors EBP50/NHE-RF1 and E3KARP/NHE-RF2 (Murthy et al., 1998; Nguyen et al., 2001), the mechanism whereby Merlin controls cell proliferation remains poorly understood (McClatchey and Giovannini, 2005).We have recently found that a signature of Nf2 defi ciency in several types of primary cells, including both mesenchymal and epithelial cells, is a failure to undergo contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation and to establish stable cadherin-mediated adherens junctions (AJs) between cells (Lallemand et al., 2003). Merlin is regulated by cell–cell contact (Shaw et al., 1998), local-izes to AJs, and physically associates with AJ components. Although core cadherin–catenin complexes are present in the membrane of Nf2−/− cells, stable AJ structures are not maintained. Defective AJs and loss of contact-dependent inhibition of prolif-eration may explain the tumorigenic and metastatic consequences of Nf2 defi ciency. However, the nature of the mitogenic signals that drive proliferation of Nf2−/− cells with defective AJs is not known; indeed, the general mechanism of contact-mediated inhi-bition of proliferation is not well understood.Here we present novel mechanistic insight into a critical role for the NF2 tumor suppressor, Merlin, in coordinating the processes of AJ stabilization with contact-dependent inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity.

McClatcheyMGH Center for Cancer Research and Harvard Medical School Department of Pathology, Charlestown, MA 02129The neuroﬁ bromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppres-sor, Merlin, is a membrane/cytoskeleton-associated protein that mediates contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation. Here we show that upon cell–cell contact Merlin coordinates the processes of adherens junction stabilization and negative regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by restraining the EGFR into a membrane compartment from which it can neither signal nor be internalized. In conﬂ uent Nf2−/− cells, EGFR activation persists, driving continued proliferation that is halted by speciﬁ c EGFR inhibitors. These studies deﬁ ne a new mechanism of tumor suppression, provide mecha-nistic insight into the poorly understood phenomenon of contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation, and suggest a therapeutic strategy for NF2-mutant tumors.Correspondence to Andrea I.

Upon cell–cell contact, Merlin associates with EGFR via NHE-RF1 and prevents both ligand-induced EGFR  internalization and the association of EGFR with its canonical effectors, pre-cluding downstream signaling. Our data are consistent with a model whereby upon cell contact Merlin restrains EGFR into a membrane compartment from which it can neither signal nor be internalized. These studies reveal a novel mechanism of tumor suppressor function, linking the function of Merlin to that of a well-known oncogene and suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy for NF2 mutant tumors.ResultsCell density–dependent regulation of EGFR by MerlinOur previous studies suggest that due to their inability to es-tablish stable AJs, Nf2−/− cells continue to proliferate after reach-ing confl uence. However, these studies do not reveal the source of mitogenic signals that drive the continued proliferation of confl uent Nf2−/− cells—in essence the mechanism whereby Nf2- expressing cells normally undergo contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation. We could not detect altered β-catenin activity, nuclear localization, or changes in specifi c cadherin expression in these cells, suggesting that activated β-catenin does not drive the overproliferation of confl uent Nf2−/− cells (Fig. S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703010/DC1; not depicted); in fact, normal levels of cadherin-associated β-catenin are present in the membranes of confl uent Nf2−/− cells (Lallemand et al., 2003). Instead, confl uent Nf2−/− cells exhibit sustained activation of signaling molecules that are not known β-catenin targets (Fig. 1 E).Alternatively, accumulating evidence suggests that cadherin-dependent cell adhesion can control mitogenic signaling by nega-tively regulating receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) at the plasma membrane (Takahashi and Suzuki, 1996; Grazia Lampugnani et al., 2003; Qian et al., 2004). To determine whether Merlin function is important for contact-dependent inhibition of RTK signaling, we compared the profi le of protein tyrosine phos-phorylation in wild-type and Nf2−/− mouse embryo fi broblasts (MEFs) as they progress to high cell density with an increasing area of cell–cell contact in the presence of serum (see Fig. S2 A for a defi nition of confl uence; available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703010/DC1). As shown in Fig. 1 A, tyrosine phosphor ylation of multiple proteins in a total membrane fraction was sharply down-regulated in confl uent wild-type MEFs but not in confl uent Nf2−/− MEFs. Upon serum depriva-tion, phosphotyrosine (pTyr) levels declined in both confl uent wild-type and Nf2−/− membranes, indicating their dependence upon soluble growth factors (Fig. 1 A, right). Thus, in prolifer-ating wild-type MEFs, serum growth factors maintain a physio-logical level of tyrosine kinase activity that is down-regulated as Figure 1. Persistent EGFR signaling in multi-ple types of conﬂ uent Nf2 −/− cells. (A) Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in total membrane preparations from MEFs at increasing stages of conﬂ uence. At early conﬂ uence (*) in the presence of serum, wild-type (top) and Nf2−/− (bottom) cells display a similar pattern of pTyr; (see Fig. S2 for the deﬁ nition of conﬂ uence). Progression to late conﬂ uence is accompanied by marked down-regulation of tyrosine kinase activity in wild-type, but not Nf2−/− cells (left). In contrast, both wild-type and Nf2−/− cells can down-regulate membrane pTyr after se-rum starvation (right). Actin = loading control. (B) EGFR activation, detected with an antibody against phosphorylated Y845, parallels the pTyr content observed in response to increasing conﬂ uence and serum starvation. In wild-type MEFs, pEGFR levels decrease as conﬂ uence progresses, but remain high in Nf2−/− cells in a serum-dependent manner. (C) Phosphor-ylation of multiple EGFR tyrosine residues is down-regulated in wild-type late-conﬂ uent primary MEFs and OBs grown in serum, but persist in the absence of Merlin. (D) Mem-branes of conﬂ uent Nf2−/− LDCs display high pEGFR levels that are markedly reduced upon adenoviral reintroduction of Nf2wt, but not mu-tant Nf2L64P. Nf2L64P is underrepresented in the membrane fraction, but comparable to that of Nf2wt in the total cell extract (tce). (E) Persistent activation of multiple EGFR targets is evident in membrane extracts from conﬂ uent Nf2−/− cells compared with wild-type. Phosphorylated active forms are indicated by the letter “p” preceding the name of the protein. All experi-ments were performed at least three times.MERLIN INHIBITS EGFR SIGNALING • CURTO ET AL.895confl uence progresses; this down-regulation is  defective in the absence of Merlin.Genetic cooperativity has been demonstrated between NF2 and EGFR pathway mutations in Drosophila (LaJeunesse et al., 2001). Moreover, the EGFR localizes to cell junctions, regulates cell adhesion, and can be negatively modulated by cadherin-dependent cell contact (Hoschuetzky et al., 1994; Takahashi and Suzuki, 1996; Pece and Gutkind, 2000; Betson et al., 2002; Qian et al., 2004). However, the basis of coordination between cell–cell contact and EGFR activity is not known. Given the prominent pTyr-containing protein of 170 kD (the molecular weight of EGFR) apparent in confl uent Nf2−/− membranes (Fig. 1 A), we used antibodies against active, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) to monitor EGFR activation in confl uent wild-type and Nf2−/− cells. We found that the steady-state levels of active EGFR also diminished with increasing cell density in membranes of wild-type MEFs but persisted in Nf2−/− MEFs (Fig. 1 B).To determine whether EGFR deregulation is a general signature of Nf2 defi ciency, we examined EGFR activation in confl uent primary osteoblasts (OBs) and liver-derived epithelial cells (LDCs), two key targets of Nf2-associated tumorigenesis in mice (McClatchey et al., 1998; Giovannini et al., 2000). Neither Nf2−/− OBs nor LDCs undergo contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation (Fig S2 B; see Fig. 6). Like MEFs, wild-type OBs down-regulate membrane pTyr and pEGFR at high cell density in the presence of serum, whereas Nf2−/− OBs maintain elevated levels of both (Fig. 1 C; not depicted). Similarly, confl uent Nf2−/− LDCs retain high levels of pEGFR (Fig. 1 D). Reintro-duction of wild-type Nf2 (Nf2wt) into Nf2−/− MEFs, OBs, and LDCs restores contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation, electrondense AJs, and low levels of both pTyr and pEGFR (Fig. 1 D, Fig. 2 B; Fig. S2 C; not depicted). In contrast, a version of Merlin containing a patient-derived missense mutation (Nf2L64P) fails to stably localize to AJs (Lallemand et al., 2003; Fig. 3 C), inhibit proliferation, or reduce pEGFR levels (Fig. 1 D). Multiple tyrosine residues on the EGFR and multiple EGFR targets remain phosphorylated in confl uent Nf2−/− cells, suggesting that a program of EGFR signaling fails to be down-regulated (Gschwind et al., 2004) (Fig. 1, C and E). These data indicate that a continuous physiological activation of the EGFR persists in the membranes of confl uent Nf2−/− cells; this is consistent with the fact that they do not proliferate faster than wild-type cells, but proliferate continuously despite reaching confl uence. Thus, three different cell types all fail to undergo contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation and to down-regulate EGFR signaling at high cell density in the absence of Merlin.Merlin controls the activity and membrane distribution of EGFR upon cell–cell contactTo understand how Merlin normally controls EGFR activity, we examined EGFR signaling as wild-type cells reach high density. Confl uent epithelial cells of breast and kidney origin become unresponsive to stimulation by EGF and other growth factors via a cadherin-dependent mechanism (Takahashi and Suzuki, 1996; Qian et al., 2004). Accordingly, we found that while acute EGF stimulation of confl uent Nf2-expressing cells does induce tyro-sine phosphorylation of the receptor itself, activation of EGFR effectors such as Src and Raf does not increase, suggesting that signal propagation from the activated EGFR is prevented once wild-type cells reach high cell density (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, stimulation of confl uent Nf2−/− cells results in a slight increase in the already elevated membrane phosphotyrosine content (Fig. 2 A). Reintroduction of Nf2wt but not Nf2L64P restored the block of EGFR signaling at high cell density (Fig. 2 B). Merlin does not appear to be a general  inhibitor of RTK activation because signaling from the IGF-I receptor, including its ability Figure 2. Merlin prevents EGFR signaling in conﬂ uent cells. (A) In late-conﬂ uent (L) wild-type MEFs, EGF-induced pTyr is limited to the EGFR with-out concomitant activation of EGFR downstream effectors such as Src and Raf. Increased membrane pTyr is already present in late-conﬂ uent Nf2−/− MEFs. The response to IGF-I is not prevented by Merlin. (EGF: 40 ng/ml, 30 min; IGF-I: 100 ng/ml, 30 min) (E = early conﬂ uence; co = loading controls). (B) Reintroduction of Nf2wt but not Nf2L64P abrogates persistent membrane pTyr in late-conﬂ uent Nf2−/− MEFs; as in wild-type MEFs, EGF stimulation of Nf2wt-expressing MEFs affects pTyr of only the EGFR itself. (C) Surface EGFR turnover in late-conﬂ uent OBs. Conﬂ uent wild-type and Nf2−/− OBs were surface biotinylated at 4°C for 1 h and then shifted to 37°C in the presence of serum. At the indicated time points, the amount of biotinylated EGFR remaining in the cell was evaluated in both the total bio-tinylated fraction and in EGFR immunoprecipitates. Compared with wild-type OBs (top panels), Nf2−/− OBs (bottom panels) show accelerated clearing of surface-biotinylated EGFR. All experiments were performed at least three times.JCB • VOLUME 177 • NUMBER 5 • 2007 896to transactivate the EGFR (Roudabush et al., 2000), occurs in confl uent MEFs regardless of the Nf2 status (Fig. 2 A).Induced phosphorylation of EGFR without activation of downstream targets in confl uent, Nf2-expressing cells suggested that in this context the ability of the activated receptor to acquire signaling competence might be physically restricted by Merlin at cell confl uence. Because Merlin is membrane associated and internalization of liganded EGFR is intimately linked to its signal-ing output (Sorkin and Von Zastrow, 2002), we asked whether the absence of Merlin had any effect on the surface levels of EGFR. We biotin-labeled cell surface proteins in confl uent wild-type and Nf2−/− OBs. Although major differences in the levels of surface EGFR were not detected in wild-type and Nf2-expressing cells, clearance of EGFR was more rapid in confl uent Nf2−/− cells, consistent with an increased rate of activation and inter-nalization (Fig. 2 C).Merlin prevents EGFR internalization and effector association in contacting cellsTo further explore the role of Merlin in EGFR membrane  localization we used Texas red–conjugated EGF (Tr-EGF) to visually track the EGFR in the presence and absence of Merlin. For these experiments we chose to use epithelial LDCs that are amenable to immunofl uorescence localization analyses. In con-fl uent Nf2−/− LDCs we found that within 30 min after stimula-tion Tr-EGF localizes to intracellular vesicles in virtually every cell, consistent with ligand-activated EGFR internalization (Fig. 3 A and Fig. S3 A, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703010/DC1). We then generated mosaic cultures to compare Nf2−/− LDCs to neighboring cells into which Nf2wt or Nf2L64P were reintroduced. Tr-EGF internaliza-tion was prevented by expression of Nf2wt that, like EGFR, is enriched at cell–cell boundaries (Fig. 3 B and Fig. S3 B), but Figure 3. Control of EGFR internalization and signaling by Merlin is contact dependent. (A–F) Internalization of ﬂ uorescent Tr-EGF (2 μg/ml, 30 min) in conﬂ uent LDCs.

(C) Tr-EGF internaliza-tion is not prevented in cells expressing Nf2L64P or, (D) in cells that express Nf2wt but are situated at the free edge of a scrape wound.

Cells with internalized Tr-EGF were designated as positive (error bars, ± SD). (H) Disruption of intercellular adhesion by Ca2+-depletion restores EGFR signaling in Nf2wt-expressing LDCs.

An identical response was seen after basolateral exposure to Tr-EGF (not depicted). Inter-nalization of fl uorescent transferrin proceeded similarly in the presence or absence of Merlin (Fig. S3 C). Importantly, Nf2wt did not prevent Tr-EGF internalization from the free edge of cells bordering a scrape wound or small colony (Fig. 3, D and G; not depicted), consistent with the hypothesis that Merlin limits EGFR internalization specifi cally upon cell–cell contact. In fact, disruption of cadherin-based intercellular adhesion by EGTA/Ca2+ depletion resulted in the appearance of internalized Tr-EGF (Fig. 3, E and F) and increased EGFR signaling in Nf2wt-expressing cells (Fig. 3 H). Importantly, endogenous levels of Merlin also prevented EGFR internalization in similar mosaic cultures (Fig. S3 D).These results suggest that upon cell contact Merlin func-tions to physically restrict ligand-activated EGFR from signaling. This interpretation is supported by the altered distribution of pEGFR in fractionated Triton-insoluble membranes in the ab-sence of Merlin (Fig. 4 A). Although EGF stimulation of confl uent wild-type cells yields the appearance of pEGFR that is confi ned to higher density fractions (II and III) that also contain Merlin, both pEGFR and Merlin are excluded from frac-tion I (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, upon EGF stimulation of confl uent Nf2−/− cells, a substantial pool of pEGFR appears in the lowest density fraction (I; Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that the physical state of pEGFR is altered in the absence of Merlin. Merlin, EGFR, and AJ components are all normally enriched in the Triton-insoluble membrane fraction, a poorly defi ned bio-chemical compartment enriched in signaling molecules and cyto skeletal components and variously referred to as detergent-resistant membranes, lipid rafts, cholesterol-rich domains, etc. (Adams et al., 1996; Roepstorff et al., 2002; Lucero and Robbins, 2004; Stickney et al., 2004). Notably, the membrane distribution of Rac and RhoGDI, two proteins implicated in Merlin func-tion, is unaffected by the absence of Merlin; in fact, in contrast to a recent report (Okada et al., 2005), we do detect recruitment of Rac to detergent-resistant membranes in both the presence and absence of Merlin (Fig. 4 A; not depicted). Consistent with this interpretation, reintroduction of Nf2wt but not Nf2L64P alters the solubility of EGFR in confl uent LDCs (Fig. S4 A, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703010/DC1).As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the propagation of signaling from the activated EGFR to its downstream targets is blocked in confl uent Nf2-expressing cells. Therefore, we asked whether Merlin directly interferes with the ability of ligand-activated EGFR to interact with its canonical signaling effectors. Consistent with established models of EGFR activation, EGF stimulation of confl uent Nf2−/− LDCs causes EGFR to interact with Cbl, Grb2, Sos, and PLCγ; however, these interactions do not occur in the presence of Merlin (Fig. 4 B). Reintroduction of Nf2wt, but not Nf2L64P, prevents EGFR association with its immediate effectors in response to EGF despite phosphorylation of the EGFR itself (Fig. 4 B); in fact, we do not detect changes in the responsiveness of EGFR to EGF ligand (Fig. S4 B). Impor-tantly, under these conditions wild-type Merlin, but not Nf2L64P, physically associates with the EGFR (Fig. 4 B). Altogether, these data suggest that Merlin prevents EGFR from interact-ing with its immediate targets by sterically hindering the inter-action and/or by sequestering the EGFR into a non-signaling membrane compartment from which both access to its down-stream effectors and internalization are impeded. These data also indicate that Merlin acts at a step that precedes endocytosis of the activated EGFR. Indeed, EGF-induced Src activation and EGFR interaction with Grb2 and Cbl, early events that are re-quired for EGFR internalization, do not occur in confl uent Nf2-expressing cells (Wilde et al., 1999; Stang et al., 2004; Johannessen et al., 2006).The PDZ domain–containing adaptor NHE-RF1 mediates Merlin–EGFR associationNHE-RF1 is a PDZ domain–containing adaptor that interacts with Merlin and the ERM proteins (Reczek et al., 1997; Murthy et al., 1998; for review see Bretscher et al., 2002)  and is thought to play an important role in controlling the surface availability of certain membrane receptors including the β-adrenergic re-ceptor and cystic fi brosis transmembrane conductance regulator (for review see Weinman et al., 2006). Importantly, recent stud-ies indicate that NHE-RF1 can also interact with and alter the surface availability of the EGFR (Lazar et al., 2004). This raises Figure 4. Merlin controls EGFR membrane dis-tribution and access to downstream effectors. (A) Optiprep gradient fractionation of Triton-insoluble membranes from late-conﬂ uent wild-type and Nf2−/− MEFs reveals altered physical distribution of pEGFR in Nf2−/− cells after EGF stimulation (40 ng/ml, 30 min). In wild-type cells, pEGFR appears predominantly in fractions II and III, where Merlin is also present; both are excluded from the lowest density fraction I. In the absence of Merlin a unique pool of pEGFR appears in fraction I. In contrast, distribution of the small GTPase Rac is independent of Merlin status. (B) After reintroduction into Nf2−/− LDCs, Nf2wt but not Nf2L64P complexes with EGFR and prevents its interaction with multiple signal-ing effectors in re sponse to EGF (40 ng/ml, 10 min). Experimental conditions are as in Fig. 1 D. All experiments were performed at least three times.JCB • VOLUME 177 • NUMBER 5 • 2007 898the possibility that Merlin regulates the surface availability of EGFR via NHE-RF1. To determine whether NHE-RF1 medi-ates the association between Merlin and EGFR, we performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of NHE-RF1 expression in Nf2wt-expressing LDCs. Lentiviral expression of a shRNA targeting NHE-RF1 revealed that reduced NHE-RF1 expression nearly eliminated the association of Nf2wt and EGFR (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, Nf2wt associates with Ezrin regardless of the level of NHE-RF1 expression (Fig. 5 B). Importantly, NHE-RF2 does not detectably associate with EGFR in these cells and shRNA-mediated knockdown of NHE-RF2 expression has little effect on the association between Merlin and EGFR (Fig. 5 C; not depicted). These data suggest that Merlin–EGFR association is mediated specifi cally by NHE-RF1.Adhesion-dependent function of MerlinMerlin localizes to AJs and is required for AJ stabilization (Lallemand et al., 2003). Our previous studies suggest that upon cell–cell contact, Merlin is recruited to and activated at nascent AJs; indeed, Merlin also associates with E-cadherin in epithe-lial cells (Lallemand et al., 2003). The simplest interpretation of our data is that active, cadherin-associated Merlin “captures” the NHE-RF1–EGFR complex, thereby retaining it. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the association between EGFR and E-cadherin in confl uent Nf2-expressing cells is NHE-RF1 dependent, whereas the association of Merlin with E-cadherin is NHE-RF1 independent (Fig. 5, A and D). A key prediction of this model is that the association between Merlin and both NHE-RF1 and EGFR is dependent on cell–cell contact; indeed, as shown in Fig. 5 (E and F), the association between Merlin and NHE-RF1 or EGFR is dramatically enhanced with in-creasing cell density. In contrast, the association between EGFR and NHE-RF1 is not adhesion dependent (Fig S5 A, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703010/DC1). Importantly, after acute disruption of intercellular contacts by Ca2+ depletion, Merlin rapidly dissociates from EGFR (Fig. 5 F), indicating that cell–cell adhesion is a strict determinant for EGFR–Merlin association.Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR inhibits proliferation of conﬂ uent Nf2−/− cellsTo determine whether EGFR activation is responsible for the persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins and proliferation of confl uent Nf2−/− cells, we treated Nf2−/− MEFs, OBs, and LDCs with pharmacologic EGFR inhibitors. Both Compound 56 and Gefi tinib (Iressa), potent specifi c inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity (Gschwind et al., 2004), eliminated the high membrane pTyr content in confl uent Nf2−/− cells of all three cell types in the presence of serum  (Fig. 6 A; not  depicted). The specifi city of each compound was demonstrated by its ability to block EGF- but not PDGF-induced membrane pTyr (Fig. 6 A; not depicted). Importantly, before confl uence, EGFR inhibitors had only a modest effect on the proliferation of pri-mary Nf2−/− MEFs, OBs, and LDCs in the presence of serum Figure 5. NHE-RF1–mediated, contact-dependent asso-ciation of Merlin and EGFR. (A) Immunoprecipitation of EGFR from total membrane extracts of Nf2wt-expressing LDCs with and without lentiviral NHE-RF1 shRNA expres-sion revealed that the association of both Nf2wt and E-cadherin with the EGFR are nearly eliminated by NHE-RF1 knockdown. (B) Immunoprecipitation of Ezrin reveals that the association of Nf2wt with Ezrin occurs in a NHE-RF1–independent manner. (C) NHE-RF2 knockdown does not affect EGFR-Merlin association. (D) The association between Nf2wt and E-cadherin is not affected by NHE-RF1 down-regulation. (E) Immunoprecipitation of NHE-RF1 from total membrane extracts of subconﬂ uent (s) and con-ﬂ uent (c) Nf2wt-expressing LDCs revealed that the associa-tion between Nf2wt and NHE-RF1 occurs only in conﬂ uent conditions. Total IgG is shown as a control for the NHE-RF1 immunoprecipitations. (F) Immunoprecipitation of EGFR from total membrane extracts of Nf2wt-expressing LDCs when sparse (s), conﬂ uent (c), and after cell–cell contact disruption by incubation in Ca2+-depleted medium for 45 min (d). Complexing of Merlin and EGFR markedly increases from sparse to conﬂ uent cells and is abrogated by acute loss of intercellular contacts. All experiments were performed at least three times.MERLIN INHIBITS EGFR SIGNALING • CURTO ET AL.899(Fig. 6, B and C; not depicted), indicating that proliferation of non-contacting cells can be sustained by serum-derived signals other than those mediated by EGFR. However, EGFR inhibition halted proliferation at high cell density; thus, Nf2−/− cells can undergo contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation if EGFR activity is blocked. As shown in Fig. 6 D, EGFR inhibition did not restore permanent contact-dependent inhibition of prolifera-tion to Nf2−/− cells because withdrawal of the inhibitor led to re-entry into the proliferative state despite the high cell density. These results suggest that EGFR inhibitors, already in clinical use for several human cancers, could also be of therapeutic benefi t for NF2-defi cient tumors. In fact, EGFR inhibitors may actually be more effi cacious in preventing the physiologic EGFR activation that persists in confl uent Nf2−/− cells rather than the high levels driven by oncogenic EGFR mutations. Notably, signaling via EGFR family members (ErbBs) is critical for the proliferation and survival of Schwann cells, the principle target of NF2-associated tumorigenesis in humans (Garratt et al., 2000).DiscussionThe discovery, in 1993, that the NF2 tumor suppressor, Merlin, is a member of a family of membrane/cytoskeleton-associated proteins suggested a novel mechanism of tumor suppression (Rouleau et al., 1993; Trofatter et al., 1993). Amidst the identifi -cation of many Merlin-interacting proteins and Merlin-controlled activities, a clear role for Merlin in controlling contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation has emerged (Morrison et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 2002; Lallemand et al., 2003). Loss of contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation is a signature of cell trans-formation, but the molecular basis of this phenomenon is not known. Our previous work identifi ed a role for Merlin in stabi-lizing AJs between cells, but did not pinpoint the mitogenic sig-nal that drives proliferation in the absence of Merlin and normal AJs (Lallemand et al., 2003). An intimate relationship between RTK activity and AJ stability clearly exists, but its molecular un-derpinnings are only beginning to emerge (for review see Brunton et al., 2004). We have now found that Merlin directly interferes with EGFR signaling in a contact-dependent manner, providing key insight into the molecular basis of contact-dependent inhibi-tion of proliferation and directly linking the functions of a novel tumor suppressor and a well-known oncogene.The aberrant cell–cell communication and persistent EGFR signaling in confl uent Nf2−/− cells, together with the localization of EGFR to AJs, suggests that Merlin normally co-ordinates the processes of AJ stabilization and negative regula-tion of the EGFR by establishing their interdependence as they occur. Our data are consistent with a model wherein the following sequence of events occurs (Fig. 7 A): Merlin is recruited to nascent AJs (Lallemand et al., 2003) where it is activated and begins to stabilize the developing junctions and sequester a pool of EGFR into a compartment from which it does not have access to its immediate downstream targets and cannot be inter-nalized. Whether Merlin is in an “open” or “closed” conformation at this stage remains to be established; although many studies suggest that “active” Merlin is not phosphorylated at serine 518, it is not clear whether this hypophosphorylated form of Merlin is consistently self-associated. The ensuing localized reduction of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity at contact sites, in turn, may further stabilize AJs, perhaps via altering the phosphorylation of AJ components such as p120 (see Fig. 1 E) and/or the activity of Rac. Indeed, while initial stages of AJ formation are accom-panied by increased tyrosine kinase activity and activation of the small GTPase Rac, a classic target of EGFR signaling that mediates dynamic membrane/cytoskeletal remodelling at cell–cell interfaces (Pece and Gutkind, 2000; Betson et al., 2002; Goodwin et al., 2003), later stages are often associated with nega-tive regulation of both EGFR and Rac (Brunton et al., 2004). This could explain previously reported roles for Merlin in nega-tively regulating both Rac and its effector Pak and in modu-lating actin cytoskeleton remodelling (James et al., 2001; Shaw et al., 2001; Kissil et al., 2003; Manchanda et al., 2005). Al-though the precise mechanism whereby Merlin associates with the actin cytoskeleton is not yet clear, we have found that as-sociation with the cortical actin cytoskeleton is necessary for the growth-suppressing and EGFR-inhibiting activities of Merlin (Cole, B.K., personal communication).Molecularly, our studies indicate that Merlin directly links the AJ and EGFR. Indeed, the trilobed structure of the four-point-one, ERM (FERM) domain appears well-designed for as-sembling multiple proteins (Pearson et al., 2000). We found that the association between Merlin and EGFR is mediated by the tandem PDZ domain–containing adaptor NHE-RF1, which is known to interact with the third lobe of the ERM FERM domain Figure 6. Pharmacological inhibitors of EGFR arrest proliferation of Nf2 −/− cells. (A) Tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins in late-conﬂ uent Nf2−/− MEFs is eliminated by the EGFR inhibitor Compound 56. In the presence of the inhibitor (added 2 h before EGF addition), pTyr in-duction is blocked after stimulation with EGF (40 ng/ml) but not PDGF (35 ng/ml) for 30 min. Similar speciﬁ city was observed for Geﬁ tinib (not depicted). Proliferation of Nf2−/− OBs (B) and LDCs (C) at high cell density is inhibited by Geﬁ nitib. (D) Inhibition of EGFR by Geﬁ tinib does not per-manently restore contact inhibition of growth in LDCs. All experiments were performed at least three times.

NHE-RF1 can as-sociate with and is thought to regulate the surface abundance of several different receptors (for review see Weinman et al., 2006). In fact, it has been reported that NHE-RF1 stabilizes and slows the down-regulation of surface EGFR (Lazar et al., 2004); how-ever, neither this nor other studies have explored how functional specifi city is applied to such a wide range of receptor interac tions, and it is not clear how temporal and spatial regulation of NHE-RF1–associated receptors is achieved. Our studies suggest that Merlin confers one such level of specifi city by locally engaging NHE-RF1–associated EGFR at the AJ.The ERM proteins also interact with NHE-RF1 and are required for stable apical localization of NHE-RF1 in the in-testinal epithelium (Saotome et al., 2004). However, the ERM proteins likely engage a distinct subset of NHE-RF–associated receptors. Consistent with the tendencies of the ERM proteins and Merlin to be apically or apical-junctionally concentrated, respectively, the ERM proteins appear to be functionally dedi-cated to the apical membrane and Merlin to the junctional domain (Fig. 7 B). By analogy to the roles of Merlin in both stabilizing the association between adhesion proteins and the actin cytoskeleton and locally “capturing” NHE-RF1–EGFR complexes, Ezrin may stabilize the association between the apical membrane and cortical cytoskeleton while capturing apical NHE-RF receptor complexes (Fig. 7 B). Indeed, Ezrin is required for establishing or maintaining the integrity of the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells in vivo (Saotome et al., 2004). In contrast to Merlin, Ezrin does not associate with EGFR or E-cadherin, mediate contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation, or effect EGFR internalization/signaling in the cells studied here (Fig. S5 B), and overproliferation is not detected in the ERM-defi cient intestine (Saotome et al., 2004).It is clear that AJs are continuously remodelled both in confl uent monolayers in culture and in tissues in vivo. In vivo, Figure 7. Molecular and spatial attributes of Merlin function. (A) Model depicting the mechanism of Merlin-mediated coordination of AJ stabilization and EGFR down-regulation. In non-contacting cells (1), Merlin does not associate with cadherin or EGFR; however, upon cell–cell contact (2), Merlin is recruited to nascent junctions and activated, stabilizing the interaction between junctional proteins and the cortical cytoskeleton. Activated Merlin then “captures” NHE-RF1-associated EGFR (3), preventing it from internalizing or signaling. Active Merlin is likely hypophosphorylated and could be in an “open” or “closed” (self-associated) conformation; indeed, more than two conformational states of Merlin may exist. Although Merlin lacks the C-terminal actin-binding domain present in the ERM proteins, some studies suggest that Merlin can interact directly with ﬁ lamentous actin via the FERM domain. Despite an abundance of evidence linking Merlin physically and functionally to the actin cytoskeleton, the precise mechanism whereby Merlin associates with the actin cytoskeleton remains unclear. (B) Although Merlin and the ERM proteins can all interact with NHE-RF1 and NHE-RF1 can, in turn, interact with several mem-brane receptors, Merlin may be functionally dedicated to the junctional domain and the ERM proteins to the apical domain. In this way, spatial and temporal regulation of NHE-RF1–associated receptors may be achieved.MERLIN INHIBITS EGFR SIGNALING • CURTO ET AL.901all cells in solid tissues are in contact and junctional remodel-ing and cell proliferation must be exquisitely coordinated.  Localization to intercellular adhesions may render the EGFR uniquely able to sense and modulate changes in cell contact and to fi ne-tune its activity accordingly. Our molecular model of Merlin-mediated coordination of AJ stabilization and EGFR down- regulation provides ample opportunity for fl exibility. For example, phosphor ylation or phospholipid binding may alter Merlin self-association and/or membrane distribution, coordinately affecting junction stability and EGFR signaling. Indeed, both hypo- and hyperphos phorylated forms of Merlin are associated with EGFR (Fig. 4 B, Fig. 5 A), suggesting that S518 phos-phorylation may regulate Merlin-associated EGFRs. We found that the association of Merlin with E-cadherin and with NHE-RF1–EGFR are both contact dependent; however, it is interest-ing to note that while the association of Merlin with E-cadherin and NHE-RF1 is maintained after acute disruption of inter-cellular contacts (not depicted), the association between Merlin and EGFR is rapidly lost, suggesting disengagement of NHE-RF1–EGFR in this specifi c context. Our studies also indicate that the status of cell–cell contact has profound implications for the propagation of EGFR signaling. Conversely, in the context of EGFR-driven tumorigenesis, a critical line of investigation will be to determine whether oncogenic variants of the EGFR can evade the contact-dependent inhibition of signaling imposed by Merlin.Pharmacologic EGFR inhibition abolished the persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins and the prolif-eration of three types of Nf2−/− cells in the presence of serum, suggesting that EGFR activation is necessary and suffi cient to cause these phenotypes. This also suggests a novel avenue of therapeutic exploration for NF2. However, given that NHE-RF1 can associate with multiple receptors, Merlin may well affect other receptors by a similar mechanism. In fact, the results pre-sented here are complementary to those of Maitra et al. (2006), who reported altered surface availability of EGFR and other membrane receptors in Drosophila tissues lacking both Merlin and the related tumor suppressor, Expanded. Similarly, Merlin could coordinate regulation of EGFR or other receptors with alter-native adhesion receptors such as CD44; it has been proposed that Merlin mediates contact-dependent inhibition of prolifera-tion via CD44 in other cell types (Morrison et al., 2001). Indeed, the theme of Merlin-mediated coordination of cell adhesion and membrane receptor signaling is echoed by recent work in Drosophila suggesting that Merlin inhibits signaling through the Hippo/Warts/Yorkie pathway (Huang et al., 2005; Hamaratoglu et al., 2006), corresponding to the conserved Mst/Lats/Yap path-way in mammals. Activation of this pathway in response to extracellular signals appears to be coordinately regulated by Merlin and Expanded, which signals from the Fat cadherin re-ceptor (Bennett and Harvey, 2006; Silva et al., 2006; Willecke et al., 2006). However, neither the source of that extracellular signal nor the signaling receptor(s) involved have been identifi ed in mammals or fl ies (Edgar, 2006). The data presented here in-dicate that Merlin could regulate signaling through this pathway by directly coordinating EGFR signaling output with cadherin-dependent intercellular adhesion.Materials and methodsCell culture and expression vectorsWild-type and Nf2−/− primary MEFs were prepared as described previ-ously (Lallemand et al., 2003). Wild-type primary OBs were prepared from calvaria of Nf2ﬂ ox2/ﬂ ox2 newborn mice as described previously (Ducy and Karsenty, 1995). Nf2 deletion in OBs was achieved via adenoviral expression of the Cre-recombinase as we described for MEFs (Lallemand et al., 2003). Primary MEFs and OBs were used between passages 3 and 6. Epithelial Nf2−/− LDCs were derived by liver-speciﬁ c, deletion of Nf2 in vivo by crossing Nf2ﬂ ox2/ﬂ ox2 mice to transgenic Alb-Cre mice (Postic et al., 1999) (B6.Cg-Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J; Jackson Laboratories). In brief, the liver of a 12-wk-old Alb-Cre;Nf2ﬂ ox2/ﬂ ox2 mouse was removed, minced, dissociated in Liver Disso-ciation Medium (Invitrogen), and cultured in 10% FBS-DME. Wild-type epi-thelial embryonic liver cells were derived from the liver of a day-14.5 Nf2ﬂ ox2/ﬂ ox2 embryo as described by Strick-Marchand and Weiss (2002), and subsequently adapted to the standard growth conditions used for all other cell lines. Clonal cell lines were established by limiting dilution.

Polyclonal anti-NHE-RF2 (B70; gift of Anthony Bretscher, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) was used at 1:1,000. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies to rabbit, mouse, or rat were from GE Healthcare.Subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysisEqual protein amounts of total cell and membrane extracts were analyzed by Western blot as described previously (Lallemand et al., 2003) with one modiﬁ cation: the membrane pellet was directly solubilized in RIPA buffer containing 0.5% SDS. For density-gradient separation, postnuclear membrane pellets from three 150-mm dishes of late conﬂ uent MEFs were lysed on ice for 30 min in Triton-lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors), resuspended in buffer A (250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM tricine, and 1% Triton X-100 and inhibitors) containing 35% Optiprep, sequentially overlayed with 25, 15, 5, and 0% Optiprep-buffer A and centrifuged for 3.5 h at 160000 g. Fractions collected at the interfaces I = 0–5%, II = 5–15%, III = 15–25%, IV = 25–35%, and the pellet V > 35%, were resuspended in RIPA buffer and analyzed (7 μg/lane) by immunoblotting.Immunoﬂ uorescence and ligand-internalization assayLDCs plated on glass coverslips were infected with Ad.Nf2wt or Ad.Nf2L64P when ⵑ50% conﬂ uent. After 4–5 d, conﬂ uent monolayers were serum starved in 1% BSA in DME for 2 h, incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 2 μg/ml Tr-EGF (E3480; Molecular Probes) or 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-Transferrin (T13342; Molecular Probes), and ﬁ xed in 4% PFA-cytoskeletal buffer (10 mM MES, pH 6.3, 2 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, and 138 mM KCl) for 15 min at room temperature. After permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were incubated with primary anti-NF2 antibody (sc331; 1:300 in 1% BSA-PBS) overnight at 4°C. After incubation with FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated anti–rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno-research Laboratories; 1:200), coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). To create noncontacting free edges in Ad.Nf2wt-infected LDCs, monolayers growing in 10% FBS-DME were scrape-wounded with a pipet tip, allowed to recover for ⵑ6 h, and starved (2 h) before adding Tr-EGF as described above. To disrupt intercellular adhesion by depletion of extracellular Ca2+, monolayers were serum starved for 2 h, washed twice in Ca2+-free DME (Invitrogen), incubated in 2 μg/ml Tr-EGF, 1% BSA, and 5 mM EGTA in Ca2+-free DME and ﬁ xed as above at the indicated JCB • VOLUME 177 • NUMBER 5 • 2007 902time points. Images were acquired using a 63× 1.4NA oil objective lens (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) on an Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with IP Lab software and a Sony CCD camera. Final images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.Surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitationLate conﬂ uent MEFs or OBs were serum starved overnight in DME, shifted to 4°C, rinsed twice in cold PBS and incubated for 1 h with 0.5 μg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Chemical Co.) in PBS. After quenching the re action (50 mM NH4Cl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM CaCl2 for 10 min) and rinsing in PBS, cells were returned to 10% FBS-DME at 37°C and lysed in Triton-lysis buffer containing 60 mM Octylglucoside (n-Octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside; Calbiochem) at the indicated time points. Normalized extracts (600 μg total protein/400 μl) were precleared with protein A–Sepharose prebound to normal rabbit IgG for 2 h at 4°C. Anti-EGFR antibody (Ab17, Neo-Marker; 8 μg/sample) or streptavidin-coupled agarose beads (50 μl; Pierce Chemical Co.) were added to precleared extracts and incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, EGFR-containing immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A–Sepharose beads (40 μl, 2 h, at 4°C). Beads from either immunoprecipitation or biotin pull-down were washed ﬁ ve times in the above buffer and boiled 5 min in 2× sample buffer. Com-plexes were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as described above. Biotinylated-immunoprecipitated EGFR was detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Immunoprecipitations of EGFR (Ab17; 8 μg) and E-cadherin (3 μg) from LDCs were from total membrane extracts in the above Triton-Octylglucoside buffer (800 μg total protein/400 μl). To disrupt intercellular adhesion by depletion of extracellular Ca2+, conﬂ uent monolayers were washed twice in PBS/5 mM EGTA, and incubated in Ca2+-free DME (Invitrogen) containing 10% Ca2+-chelated FBS for 45 min.Cell proliferationMEFs, OBs (5 × 104) or LDCs (7.5 × 104) were seeded in triplicate 15-mm wells in 5% FBS-DME. The following day, 1 μM Geﬁ tinib (Iressa; AstraZeneca) or 0.5 μM Compound 56 (Calbiochem) were added to culture wells; cells were trypsinized and counted every other day. Fresh medium with or with-out inhibitors was added each day of counting. For drug withdrawal, 1 μM Geﬁ tinib was added to LDCs daily until day 5 post-seeding, when half of the wells were returned to 5% FBS-DME only. Beginning that day, cells were counted and fresh medium with or without inhibitor was added to the re-maining wells every other day.shRNA-mediated knockdownSeveral shRNA constructs against NHE-RF1 (#68583-68587) and NHE-RF2 (#68613-68615, 68617) in the lentiviral pLKO.1 vector were ob-tained from Open Biosystems and tested for NHE-RF1/2 knockdown in Nf2−/− LDCs; #68587 and #68617 were used for experiments. Lentiviral production and infection was performed as described previously (Bailey et al., 2006).Online supplemental materialFig. S1 shows level and distribution of adhesion molecules in various cell types used in this work.
