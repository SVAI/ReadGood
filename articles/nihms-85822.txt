Animals also received BrdU injections to label proliferating cells. In a longer-termexperiment, animals were randomized to receive trastuzumab, erlotinib (an ErbB kinase inhibitor),or placebo for 12 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) overthe treatment period. Cell death was analyzed by terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL).Results—Tumors could be distinguished with T2 weighted MRI sequences. Trastuzumabsignificantly reduced the proliferation of VS cells compared to control (p<0.01) as determined byBrdU uptake. Control tumors demonstrated slight growth over the 12 week treatment period. Bothtrastuzumab and erlotinib significantly reduced the growth of VS xenografts (p<0.05). Erlotinib, butnot trastuzumab, resulted in a significant increase in the percent of TUNEL-positive VS cells(p<0.01).Conclusions—In this preliminary study, the ErbB inhibitors trastuzumab and erlotinib decreasedgrowth of VS xenografts in nude mice raising the possibility of using ErbB inhibitors in themanagement of patients with schwannomas, particularly those with neurofibromatosis type 2.Keywordsacoustic neuroma; apoptosis; cell proliferation; magnetic resonance imagingINTRODUCTIONVestibular schwannomas (VS) result from mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, merlin orschwannomin, and occur in two forms; sporadic, isolated tumors and bilateral tumors occurringin patients with the genetic disease neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) (1-4). Current managementof VSs is limited to observation with serial imaging, stereotactic radiosurgery or radiotherapy(SRS/SRT), and microsurgical removal (5-8). While these therapies are generally well toleratedthey occasionally result in deafness, facial paralysis, spinal fluid leak, continued tumor growth,or even malignant transformation (9-14).

Most patients develop deafness and other cranial and spinalneuropathies and many ultimately succumb to their disease (16). Discovery of alternativetherapies that limit the growth of schwannomas may be of particular benefit to patients withNF2 (4,15,17).Understanding the role of the merlin protein in Schwann cell (SC) homeostasis should helpguide the development of alternative therapies for patients with schwannomas (3,4). Merlinmediates contact inhibition of cell growth and in many cells suppresses the activity ofintracellular signaling cascades implicated in tumor formation including Ras-mitogen activatedprotein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK,phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (18-24).In addition to these intracellular kinases, merlin regulates the subcellular localization andactivity of receptor tyrosine kinases (25) including the epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR), or ErbB, family of tyrosine kinases (26). Like their SC counterparts, VS cellsuniformly express ErbB2 and ErbB3, with a subset also expressing EGFR, or ErbB1, and ErbB4(27-29). A recent study found increased mRNA expression for ErbB1 and ErbB2 in most VSsand that ErbB1 expression levels correlates with tumor size (30). In normal SCs, merlin isimplicated in the cytoplasmic sequestration of ErbB2 in response to cell-cell contact (26).However, in VS cells ErbB2 constitutively resides in portions of the cell membrane known aslipid rafts and is active (28,29). This lipid raft localization of ErbB2 in VS cells mirrors themovement of ErbB2 into lipid rafts in proliferating, denervated SCs following axotomy (31).Thus, ErbB receptors represent a potential target for therapies to limit VS growth (27-30,32).Given their involvement in a number of different tumors, several ErbB inhibitors have beendeveloped and are used clinically (33).Here we tested the efficacy of two ErbB inhibitors on VS growth in a xenograft model of humanVSs using nude mice. We report that trastuzumab, a humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonalantibody, and erlotinib, an inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 kinase activity (34), both reduce thegrowth of VS xenografts as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over a 3-monthinterval. Erlotinib, but not trastuzumab, resulted in increased VS cell death in these xenografts.Thus, ErbB inhibitors serve as potential novel therapies for the treatment of schwannomas.MATERIALS AND METHODSVestibular Schwannoma XenograftsXenografts were developed in male athymic Ncr Nu/Nu mice (National Cancer Institute, NIH,Bethesda, MD) from VS specimens derived from four separate patients. All patients providedwritten, informed consent for use of tumor harvested at time of surgery. The institutional reviewboard at the University of Iowa approved the study protocol and the University of IowaInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. Mice werehoused in a barrier room and watered and fed rodent chow freely.Acutely resected VS specimens were transported to the laboratory in ice cold Hank’s BalancedSalt Solution (Invitrogen, Calsbad, CA), cut into approximately 10 mm3 fragments, and placedinto the interscapular fat pad in nude mice anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg, Hospira,Lake Forest, IL) and xylazine (10 mg/kg Phoenix Scientific, St. Joseph, MO). The grafts wereallowed to develop for 4 weeks prior to initiating any treatment.Measurement of tumor volumeTumor volume was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mice were removedfrom the barrier facility and imaged in a small animal MRI (Varian Unity/INOVA 4.7 Teslascanner, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). T2- weighted images were acquired in the axial andClark et al.Page 2Otol Neurotol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 September 1.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptsagittal planes by placing an anesthetized mouse inside a 37.5 mm diameter transmit/receivevolume coil. Slice thickness was 0.5 mm in each plane. To calculate the tumor volume, thesurface area of the tumor on each sequential image was determined using the measurementtool on Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) by drawing a region of interest encompassingthe tumor. The reviewer was blinded to the experimental group. The measurements wererepeated three times in both the axial and sagittal planes and the average tumor surface areawas multiplied by the slice thickness (0.5 mm) to calculate the slice volume. Slice volumeswere halved for the initial and final slices of each imaging series. Slice volumes were thensummed for total tumor volume. We also calculated total tumor volumes using the entirevolume of the initial and final slices for each series. This did not affect the overall results ofthe experiments. To calculate the relative tumor growth, the initial tumor volume (Vi) wassubstracted from the final tumor volume (Vf) and the difference was divided by Vi ([Vf-Vi]/Vi) to account for differences in initial xenograft volumes. There was no significant differencein the relative tumor growth rates of the trastuzumab control and erlotinib control animals andthe data from these animals were pooled.Treatment with ErbB inhibitorsA total of 19 mice bearing human VS xenografts derived from 4 separate patients were analyzedin this study. Table 1 presents the distribution of VS specimens used for these studies. In apreliminary experiment, 4 mice were implanted with VSs derived from two patients and wererandomly divided into two groups four weeks after tumor implantation. Two mice receivedtrastuzumab (25 mg/kg in 0.25 ml normal saline i.p., Genentech, South San Francisco, CA)three times per week for two weeks while two animals received saline injections. During thefinal week of treatment, all mice were injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO) daily to label dividing cells. After the two-week treatment interval, the xenograftswere harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).For the longer-term experiment, the xenografts were derived from 2 additional VSs and initialimages with MRI were obtained four weeks after tumor implantation. Following the initialMRI, the mice were returned to a quarantine room where they were randomly divided intothree groups of 5 animals each (15 total). One group received trastuzumab (25 mg/kg i.p.) threetimes per week. This is similar to trastuzumab doses shown to inhibit growth of xenograftsderived from human carcinomas that overexpress ErbB2 (35,36). The second group was gavagefed erlotinib (50 mg/kg, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), five days a week. This is similarto erlotinib doses shown to reduce growth of xenografts derived from non-small cell lung cancerand malignant nerve sheath tumors (37,38). Erlotinib was suspended in a solution of 0.5%methyl cellulose (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and 0.4% Tween-80 (Fischer Scientific,Pittsburgh, PA). The final group of mice served as controls. In this group, three animals weregavage fed erlotinib vehicle and two animals received saline injections for trastuzumab control.Treatment continued for 12 weeks. Following completion of the treatment, the mice were onceagain imaged to determine final tumor volume and the xenografts were harvested and fixed in4% paraformaldehyde.Immunofluorescence and TUNEL stainingFollowing fixation, the xenografts were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) andcryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The samples were then embedded in optimum cuttingtemperature (OCT) compound (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and cryosectionedat 10-15 μm. Frozen sections from the preliminary group of animals were treated with 2N HClfor 30 min, permeabilized with 0.8% Triton-X100 in PBS for 20 min, and then blocked withblocking buffer (5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.8% Triton-X100) for 30min. Next, the samples were incubated in mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU (1:800, Sigma-Aldrich,St. Louis, MO) and rabbit anti-S100 (1:800, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted in blockingClark et al.Page 3Otol Neurotol.

Following several washes in PBS, secondary antibodies (anti-mouseAlexa Fluor 568 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 1:800 each, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) dilutedin PBS were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were then labeled with Hoechst 3342(10 μg/ml, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min and the slides were mounted and coverslipped.Frozen sections from the longer-term groups of animals were labeled with anti-S100 antibodyas above. Following immunostaining, terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) wasperformed as previously described (39) and the nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 3342. Digitalimages were captured on a Leica DMIRE2 epifluorescence microscope (Bannockburn, IL)equipped with a CCD camera and Leica FW4000 software.Determination of cell proliferation and cell deathCell proliferation was determined by assaying BrdU uptake in xenograft frozen sections aspreviously described (31). The number of BrdU-positive S100-positive cells was determinedfrom digital images from five randomly selected 30x microscopic fields (331±108 VS cellnuclei/30x field, mean±SD) for each of 3 frozen sections/xenograft (fifteen 30x microscopicfields/xenograft). The average percent of BrdU-positive VS cells was determined for eachxenograft. The investigator was blinded to treatment conditions.Cell death was determined using TUNEL to identify apoptotic VS cells as previously described(39). The number of TUNEL-positive S100-positive nuclei was determined from five randomlyselected 30x microscopic fields for each of 3 frozen sections/xenograft and the average percentof TUNEL-positive cells was determined for each xenograft. The investigator was blinded totreatment conditions.Statistical AnalysisDifferences in cell proliferation and cell death were analyzed by Student’s two-tailed t-testusing Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Differences in relative tumor growth wereanalyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post-hoc Kruskal-Wallistest using SigmaStat (Systat Incorporated, Richmond, CA).ReagentsTrastuzumab was a generous gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Erlotinib,ketamine, and xylazine were obtained from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinicspharmacy. All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwisespecified.RESULTSTumor imaging and cell proliferationTo test the ability of ErbB inhibitors to limit VS growth, we used a xenograft model bytransplanting fragments of freshly excised VSs into the interscapular subcutaneous fat of nudemice. Initially, we performed a proof of principle experiment to verify that cells in thexenografts remained viable and were capable of dividing. We also tested the efficacy oftrastuzumab to reduce VS cell proliferation in these xenografts since it has already been shownto reduce VS cell proliferation in vitro (29). Xenografts were allowed to establish for 4 weeksin 4 nude mice. Figure 1 shows representative MRI imaging of xenografts 4 weeks aftertransplantation. Figure 1 also shows a frozen section immunolabeled with the Schwann cellmarker anti-S100 antibody and Hoechst (nuclear stain). This section was taken from the edgeof the graft to illustrate the specificity of S100 immunolabeling for viable tumor cells comparedwith the cells comprising the tumor capsule that fail to label with anti-S100 antibody.Clark et al.Page 4Otol Neurotol.

All animals werealso injected with BrdU daily for the final 7 days prior to sacrifice to allow identification ofdividing cells. Cell proliferation was determined by counting the number of BrdU-positive,S100-positive VS cell nuclei from frozen sections (Fig. 2). The results represent the averagepercent of BrdU-positive VS cells for each animal. There was a statistically significantreduction in the percent of BrdU-positive VS cells in xenografts from trastuzumab treatedanimals (0.040%±0.029% mean±SD) compared to those from control animals (0.201%±0.026%, mean±SD) (p<0.028, Student’s two-tailed t-test) in the 2 week trial.Tumor response to ErbB inhibitorsHaving demonstrated that the xenografts remained viable 4 weeks after implantation and thatwe could image them with MRI, we performed a second experiment with a separate group of15 animals to determine if ErbB inhibition could reduce the growth of the xenografts. InitialMRIs were taken 4 weeks after implantation (Fig. 1). The animals were then randomized toreceive trastuzumab, erlotinib, or placebo (the carrier compounds for the pharmaceuticalagents) for 12 weeks. Following treatment the animals were re-imaged and the xenograftsharvested to evaluate for cell death. One tumor in the erlotinib treated group did not appear onthe final MRI.Relative tumor growth was determined by comparing the difference in tumor volumes betweenthe initial and final MRI images normalized to the initial tumor volume. Control animalsdemonstrated a slight increase in relative tumor volume (0.23±0.15, mean±SE) whiletrastuzumab (-0.32±0.09, mean±SE) and erlotinib (-0.50±0.16, mean±SE) resulted in reductionin tumor volume (Fig. 3). The difference in tumor growth was statistically significant betweencontrol and trastuzumab (p=0.025, one way ANOVA followed by Kruskal-Wallis) anderlotinib (p=0.017) treated animals, but was not significantly different between either treatmentgroup (p=0.375).In Figure 3, control animals (n=5) receiving saline injections (n=2) or erlotinib vehicle bygavage (n=3) were pooled since there was no known biological effect of either placebo andthere was no statistical difference (p=0.65) in relative tumor growth for animals receiving saline(0.13±0.3, mean±SE) or erlotinib vehicle (0.32±0.28, mean±SE). If we analyze the data withoutpooling the control animals, the mean relative tumor growth in animals receiving erlotinib isstatistically less than animals receiving ertoltinib vehicle (p=0.01, Student’s two-tailed t-test).Similarly, the mean relative tumor growth in animals receiving trastuzumab trended less thananimals receiving saline injections (p=0.09, Student’s two-tailed t-test).Erlotinib induces cell death in VS xenograftsTreatment with ErbB inhibitors caused a reduction in the final tumor volume compared withthe initial volume raising the possibility that the inhibitors may cause death of the VS cells. Toexamine this possibility we stained frozen sections of the xenografts with TUNEL which labelsapoptotic nuclei. There was no significant difference in the percentage of TUNEL positivecells between xenografts from animals receiving trastuzumab injections (0.24% ± 0.04%, mean± SE) compared with saline injected animals (0.29% ± 0.09%, mean ± SE). However, tumorsections harvested from animals treated with erlotinib demonstrated a significant increase inthe percentage of TUNEL positive cells compared to the placebo controls (p<0.01, Student’stwo-tailed t-test). This control group demonstrated 0.36% ± 0.06% (mean ± SE) TUNELpositive VS cells compared with 0.76% ±0.14% (mean ± SE) for the erlotinib treated group.Clark et al.Page 5Otol Neurotol.

These encouraging results need to be replicatedwith tumors derived from a larger group of patients and in other models of VS disease.Nevertheless, they identify a systemic therapy capable of reducing VS growth in vivo and areparticularly relevant to patients with NF2 who often suffer multiple cranial and spinalneuropathies due to schwannoma growth.In this study we did not screen the tumors for merlin mutations and thus it is not possible todetermine if the effects seen here are mutation specific (40-43). Likewise, the expression ofErbB receptors was not determined in these tumors as the entire xenograft specimen wasconsumed in cell proliferation and death analyses. However, several studies confirm that VSsuniversally express both ErbB2 and ErbB3, similar to their Schwann cell counterparts(27-30,32). Significantly, ErbB2 is activated in VSs and drives cell proliferation.(27-29,32)The extent of ErbB1 and ErbB4 expression in VSs is less clear yet a recent study suggests thatErbB1 expression correlates with tumor size (30).Models of vestibular schwannomas and NF2 diseaseRepresentative models to evaluate therapeutic agents for VSs and NF2 are lacking. Severalinvestigators have developed VS xenograft models (44-47). In general, these tumors grow veryslowly, mimicking their behavior in patients (7,48). Similarly, in our study, control tumorsdemonstrated slight growth over a three-month interval. Thus, sophisticated and sensitiveimaging modalities are required to detect small differences in tumor growth (44). Here we usedT2 weighted MRI sequences which were able to clearly delineate tumor volumes.Transgenic animals represent an alternative model of NF2 disease. Heterozygous mice carryinggermline mutations in merlin (Nf2-/Nf2+) develop osteosarcomas and liver tumors but fail todevelop schwannomas (49,50). Mice carrying biallelic targeted deletion of merlin exon 2 inSCs develop SC hyperplasia and peripheral nerve schwannomas that can be imaged with MRI,representing a potential model to evaluate therapies aimed at reducing schwannoma formationor growth (51-53). However, these mice do not appear to develop VSs. Cell cultures allow forhigher through put screening and complement animal models. Of particular relevance to theresults of these experiments, trastuzumab reduces cell proliferation in primary VS culturesderived from human patients (29).In addition to tumor imaging, we also analyzed the proliferative capacity of VS cells in thesexenografts. Consistent with their slow growth rates, we found that only 0.2% of VS cellsincorporated BrdU in control animals treated with daily doses of BrdU for 7 days. Bycomparison, approximately 0.5% of denervated eighth nerve SCs in rats incorporate BrdU after4 systemic doses (Provenzano, et. al., unpublished data) suggesting that the proliferative rateof VS cells is somewhat comparable to that of denervated SCs. This low proliferative rate isconsistent with the slow tumor growth observed on MRI and with the clinical behavior of mostVSs in humans.Potential therapies for NF2Understanding the cellular and molecular events contributing to schwannoma formation andgrowth will help guide the development of novel therapies. Recent studies have identified manyof the signaling molecules that are regulated by merlin and are implicated in tumor formation.In particular, several intracellular kinases are inhibited by merlin including ERK, Akt, JNK,PAK (18-24) Since dysregulated activity of these kinases contributes to neoplasia, severalinhibitory reagents have been developed and represent potential therapies for VSs (54).Clark et al.Page 6Otol Neurotol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 September 1.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptIn addition to intracellular kinases, activation of ErbB2, a receptor tyrosine kinase essential forSC development, proliferation, and survival, appears to contribute to Schwann cell neoplasia,including VSs (27-29,32,55-58). The contribution of ErbB family members to neoplasia ingeneral is well established and many molecules that inhibit ErbB family members are usedclinically in the management of breast, head and neck, lung, central nervous system, and othermalignancies (59). In general, these ErbB inhibitors display fewer side effects than cytotoxicagents and may be more suitable for long-term therapy as would likely be required in NF2patients (33).The purpose of this preliminary study was to validate the xenograft model of VS and the generalability of ErbB inhibitors to reduce tumor growth. It was not designed to evaluate the relativeefficacy of different ErbB inhibitors, which will require a much larger sample of animals todetermine dose response relationships. However, the observation that both ErbB inhibitorsreduced tumor growth provides encouragement that targeting these molecules may ultimatelyprove effective.ConclusionsIn summary, we have shown that trastuzumab and erlotinib reduced the growth of VSxenografts. Although the growth of tumors was very slow, we were able to detect smalldifferences in tumor growth using MRI and complement the imaging studies with assays ofcell proliferation and death. These results raise the possibility of using ErbB inhibitors assystemic therapy to limit schwannoma growth in patients with NF2 or those unsuitable forcurrent therapies.AcknowledgementsWe thank Dan Thedens for assistance with MRI.
